   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged that Mazzola collected a significant portion of the evidence but insisted that they also participated in the collection process. They maintained that their previous testimony was accurate, albeit with some uncertainty about specific details.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's involvement in collecting blood samples, with the defense asserting she did most of the work while the witness conceded she did a good portion but claimed to have assisted as well.
   - The defense questioned the witness's response time to the crime scene, suggesting it was too long and could have compromised evidence integrity. The witness confirmed the timing but did not acknowledge any negative implications of the delay.
   - The witness's recollection of events and conversations with detectives was also challenged, particularly regarding their knowledge of the victims and the suspect status of O.J. Simpson, leading to further disputes about the witness's credibility and the handling of the crime scene.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper crime scene management and questioned the witness's reliability regarding the collection of blood evidence, particularly focusing on the role of Andrea Mazzola in swatching blood drops and the potential for contamination due to procedural errors.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged the principles of crime scene protection and confirmed that Mazzola collected most of the blood samples, but also indicated that he participated in the collection process. He maintained that he performed some functions accurately, although he could not recall specifics.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**

   - The defense questioned the witness about the timing of his arrival at the crime scenes and the implications of delayed evidence processing, particularly regarding the blood samples collected and the potential for contamination due to improper handling and storage.
   - The witness acknowledged the possibility of contamination from a blanket that was improperly placed at the crime scene, which the defense argued was a significant oversight that could affect the integrity of the evidence collected. The witness conceded that this could be considered a mistake.
   - The defense also highlighted the importance of arriving at the crime scene before the coroner to preserve evidence, suggesting that the witness's delayed response could have compromised the investigation. The witness agreed that it is generally desirable for criminalists to arrive first but did not recall specific details about the case's urgency. 

Overall, the defense aimed to undermine the credibility of the evidence collection process, while the witness defended the actions taken during the investigation, albeit with some admissions of potential errors.

P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?

P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that the integrity of the crime scene was compromised due to improper handling and collection of evidence, particularly by Andrea Mazzola, who was alleged to have primarily collected blood samples.

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?

P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE, NO.

DEFENSE: WHICH ONE DID YOU SWATCH?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL EXACTLY WHICH ONES I ASSISTED HER WITH, BUT THERE WERE PORTIONS OF STAINS WHERE IACTUALLY TOOK THE TWEEZERS AND DID THE MANIPULATION MYSELF.

WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?

P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

The defense's questioning suggests a lack of concern or conflict, while the prosecution's objections indicate a belief that the relationship may have been more complicated and possibly abusive. The witness's uncertainty about the status of O.J. and Nicole's relationship in early 1994 further complicates the narrative, leaving room for differing interpretations of their interactions.

In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented contrasting claims regarding the relationship between O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense aimed to establish that O.J. Simpson was not concerned about Nicole dating other men after their divorce, suggesting that he did not exhibit jealousy or anger towards her relationships. They sought to portray O.J. as having a non-confrontational attitude towards Nicole's dating life and to imply that there was no history of physical abuse.
   - **Prosecution's Claim:** While the prosecution did not present a direct claim in this excerpt, their objection to the defense's line of questioning about the nature of O.J. and Nicole's relationship indicates they may be trying to highlight potential issues of domestic violence or emotional turmoil that contradict the defense's portrayal.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The primary conflict arises from the defense's attempt to paint a picture of a benign relationship between O.J. and Nicole, while the prosecution likely aims to suggest that there were underlying issues, possibly including jealousy or abuse. The defense's questioning about the absence of physical contact and O.J.'s lack of concern about Nicole's dating life contrasts with the prosecution's potential narrative of a troubled relationship.
   - Additionally, there is a disagreement over the witness's knowledge of the timeline and nature of O.J. and Nicole's relationship, particularly during the critical months of February and March 1994, where the witness admits uncertainty about the status of their relationship, which could be pivotal in establishing the context of the events leading up to the incident in question.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreement:**
   - The defense's questioning focused on the absence of any signs of conflict or violence in O.J. and Nicole's relationship, emphasizing that O.J. did not express anger or concern about her dating other men. This contrasts with the prosecution's likely position that there were underlying issues in their relationship that could indicate potential motives for violence.
   - The defense also sought to portray O.J. as calm and normal on the day of the incident, while the prosecution may argue that this portrayal does not align with the events leading up to the incident. The prosecution's objection to the defense's line of questioning indicates a disagreement over the relevance and interpretation of the witness's observations regarding O.J.'s demeanor.

4. **Blood Evidence**:

In the court conversation, the key claims from each side are as follows:

1. **Defense's Claim**: The defense is attempting to establish that O.J. Simpson was not angry or upset about Nicole's dating life after their divorce, and that he maintained a normal demeanor on the day of the incident in question. They emphasize that there was no evidence of physical altercations or emotional distress from O.J. during interactions with Nicole or on the day of the events being discussed.

2. **Prosecution's Claim**: While the prosecution does not present a direct claim in this excerpt, their objection to the defense's line of questioning suggests they may be aiming to highlight potential underlying issues in O.J. and Nicole's relationship, possibly indicating that the defense's portrayal of O.J. as calm and unaffected is misleading.

**Conflicts and Disagreements**: The primary conflict arises from the defense's portrayal of O.J. Simpson as a calm and collected individual who had no issues with Nicole dating other men, contrasting with the prosecution's likely intention to suggest that there were deeper emotional or relational problems. The defense's witness testimony supports their narrative, stating that O.J. did not show anger or agitation, while the prosecution's objections indicate a disagreement over the relevance and implications of this testimony.

Simpson's demeanor and the nature of his relationship with Nicole, implying that there may have been underlying issues not visible to the witness.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The primary conflict arose from the defense's portrayal of O.J. Simpson as calm and unaffected by his relationship with Nicole, contrasting with the prosecution's likely implication that there were deeper emotional or violent issues at play. The defense's questioning aimed to highlight a lack of evidence for any physical altercations or emotional distress, while the prosecution's objections indicated a disagreement over the relevance and interpretation of the witness's observations. The defense also sought to clarify that the witness had no knowledge of O.J.'s daily life or emotional state beyond their interactions, which could undermine any claims of his potential guilt or emotional turmoil.

   - There was also a disagreement regarding the nature of O.J. and Nicole's relationship, particularly whether O.J. had concerns about her dating other men. The defense's line of questioning aimed to downplay any potential jealousy or conflict, while the prosecution likely sought to highlight any signs of distress or possessiveness that could suggest a motive for violence.

In the court conversation, the defense is focusing on the physical evidence related to Mr. Simpson, specifically the laceration on his left-hand middle knuckle and the associated swelling. The defense is likely using this information to support their argument regarding Mr. Simpson's condition or actions.

On the other hand, the prosecution may be emphasizing the significance of these injuries in relation to the case, possibly suggesting they indicate involvement in a violent incident or altercation.

The conflict arises from differing interpretations of the evidence: the defense may argue that the injuries are not indicative of guilt or wrongdoing, while the prosecution may argue that they are relevant to establishing Mr. Simpson's involvement in the case at hand.

2. **Prosecution Claim**: The prosecution, represented by the witness, maintains that the swelling appeared to be a direct result of the laceration observed on the morning of the incident.

The conflict and disagreement arise from the defense's assertion that the swelling may not be due to the laceration, implying that the injury may not be as significant as claimed.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_WITNESS) presented the following important claims and conflicts:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is questioning the reliability of the evidence related to Mr. Simpson's finger injury, suggesting that the swelling could be due to a pre-existing medical condition rather than the laceration observed by the witness. They also emphasize that Mr. Simpson voluntarily cooperated with the investigation, including allowing his finger to be examined and returning to Los Angeles without resistance.
