#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations.

The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the important claims from each side are as follows:

1. **Defense Claim**: The defense is focusing on the specifics of the identification of human remains in the People versus Crafts case, emphasizing the challenges posed by the dispersion of biological evidence due to the victim's body being processed through a wood chipper. They highlight the significant area over which the evidence was spread, suggesting that this complicates the identification process.

2. **Witness Claim**: The witness, Dr. Lee, confirms the details of the case, including the method of disposal and the resultant scattering of biological evidence. He acknowledges that while some fragments were found, the majority of the remains likely ended up in the river, which supports the defense's assertion about the difficulties in evidence recovery.

**Conflicts and Disagreement**: The conversation does not explicitly present a conflict or disagreement at this moment; rather, it appears to be a line of questioning aimed at establishing the context and challenges related to the evidence in the Crafts case. The defense is attempting to clarify the circumstances surrounding the evidence, while the witness corroborates the defense's claims about the case's complexities.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense is questioning Dr. Lee, a witness, about his involvement in the identification of human remains in a notable case, the People versus Crafts. 

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense emphasizes the complexity of the biological evidence collection process in the Crafts case, highlighting that the remains were dispersed over a large area due to the method of disposal (through a wood chipper) and that various biological samples, including human and animal remains, were mixed together during the collection process.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee confirms the defense's assertions, detailing the methods used to collect recognizable biological evidence and acknowledging that the collection process involved mixing different biological samples.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreement:**
   - There is an implicit conflict regarding the reliability of the biological evidence collected, as the defense suggests that the mixing of human remains with other biological materials could complicate the identification and analysis of the evidence. Dr. Lee's responses indicate an agreement with the defense's points, but the underlying concern about the integrity of the evidence remains a point of contention. The defense appears to be setting the stage to question the validity of the evidence linking the accused to the crime.

D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

In the court conversation, the key claims from each side are as follows:

1. **Defense Claim**: The defense is emphasizing the methodology used in the identification of human remains in the People versus Crafts case, particularly how biological evidence was collected from a large area after the victim's body was processed through a wood chipper. They highlight the challenges of mixing biological samples and the procedures followed to ensure proper evidence collection.

2. **Witness Claim**: Dr. Lee, the witness, confirms the defense's summary of the case and provides details about the evidence collection process. He acknowledges that while biological samples were mixed together, including human and animal remains, it was still appropriate to attempt DNA analysis on the evidence collected.

**Conflicts and Disagreements**: The primary conflict arises from the potential contamination and mixing of biological samples during the evidence collection process. The defense seems to be laying the groundwork to question the reliability of the DNA evidence due to the mixing of human remains with other biological materials. Dr. Lee's testimony, however, supports the validity of the DNA analysis despite these challenges, indicating a disagreement on the implications of the evidence collection methods on the integrity of the findings.

   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense emphasizes the complexity of identifying biological evidence in the Crafts case due to the extensive scattering of remains over a large area and the mixing of human biological samples with other materials, such as deer bones. They highlight the procedures used to collect and analyze the evidence, including the limitations of the technology available at the time.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee confirms the defense's assertions about the case, acknowledging the challenges in collecting and identifying the biological evidence and the fact that some DNA work was conducted, albeit limited by the technology of the mid-1980s.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a subtle conflict regarding the effectiveness of the evidence collection and analysis methods used in the Crafts case. The defense suggests that the mixing of biological samples could complicate the results, while Dr. Lee acknowledges the challenges but maintains that they proceeded with DNA analysis despite these issues. The conversation indicates a potential disagreement on the reliability of the evidence obtained from such a chaotic crime scene.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the key claims from each side are as follows:

1. **Defense Claim**: The defense is emphasizing the complexities involved in the identification of human remains, particularly in the People versus Crafts case, where biological evidence was extensively mixed and scattered due to the method of body disposal. They highlight that despite these challenges, DNA technology was applied to identify the remains, suggesting that the process was thorough and valid.

2. **Witness Claim**: Dr. Lee, the witness, supports the defense's assertion by confirming that while the biological evidence was mixed with other materials, including animal remains, it was still possible to conduct DNA analysis to identify the human remains. He acknowledges the limitations of the technology available at the time but affirms that some DNA work was indeed performed.

**Conflicts and Disagreements**:
- There is a subtle conflict regarding the effectiveness of the DNA analysis given the mixed nature of the evidence. The defense suggests that the analysis was successful despite the challenges, while the witness acknowledges the difficulties but maintains that identification was still possible.
- Additionally, the defense raises the issue of budgetary constraints faced by criminalists, which could imply that financial limitations might affect the quality or thoroughness of forensic investigations. Dr. Lee agrees with this point, indicating a shared understanding of the challenges faced in forensic science.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the challenges faced by forensic scientists, particularly regarding the identification of human remains in complex cases, such as the People versus Crafts case. They highlight the difficulties in collecting and analyzing biological evidence due to its dispersion and mixing with other materials.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee confirms the defense's assertions about the Crafts case, acknowledging that despite the mixed biological evidence, they were able to conduct some DNA analysis and identify human remains. He also agrees that forensic resources are often limited, which impacts the extent of testing that can be performed.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a subtle conflict regarding the effectiveness of the forensic methods used in the Crafts case. While the defense suggests that the mixing of biological samples complicates the analysis, Dr. Lee maintains that they were still able to achieve results despite these challenges.
   - The defense's line of questioning implies a critique of the forensic process and the limitations imposed by budgetary constraints, while Dr. Lee's responses indicate a defense of the methods used and the ability to work within those constraints, suggesting that with proper support, forensic scientists can still achieve meaningful results.

   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and challenges faced in forensic investigations, particularly regarding the identification of human remains and the limitations of forensic resources. They highlight the case of People versus Crafts to illustrate how biological evidence can be mixed and still yield results, suggesting that the absence of certain evidence (like blood on a suspect) does not necessarily imply non-involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee supports the defense's assertion about the challenges in forensic science, acknowledging that while evidence can be mixed, it is still possible to identify human remains. He agrees with the general principle that absence of evidence does not equate to evidence of absence, but he also emphasizes that the context of each situation is crucial in making such determinations.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a nuanced disagreement regarding the interpretation of the absence of evidence. While Dr. Lee agrees with the general principle from Mr. MacDonnell's article, he points out that the specific examples may not universally apply, indicating that the context of each crime scene is critical in assessing involvement.
   - The defense and Dr. Lee also discuss the limitations of forensic testing due to budgetary constraints, with Dr. Lee acknowledging that while resources are scarce, the support from leadership can help mitigate some of these issues. This suggests a potential conflict between the ideal capabilities of forensic science and the practical limitations faced in real-world applications.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.",simpson_defense_6,Dr. Henry Lee,"Dr. Henry Lee was a forensic scientist who testified for the defense in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, where he questioned the handling of blood evidence. His testimony was a turning point in the trial. ","PROSECUTION: Okay. Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and limitations of forensic evidence collection, particularly in the context of the People versus Crafts case, where biological evidence was mixed and scattered due to the method of body disposal. They argue that despite these challenges, DNA testing was attempted and yielded results, suggesting that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee supports the defense's assertion that forensic resources are often limited and that the absence of evidence does not equate to the absence of involvement in a crime. He acknowledges that various factors, including the nature of the crime scene and the distance from which a crime was committed, can affect the presence of blood spatter on a suspect.

   - There is a nuanced disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly the implications of ""absence of evidence."" While Dr. Lee generally agrees with the defense's position, he also emphasizes that the context of each situation is critical, indicating that conclusions cannot be universally applied.
   - The defense seeks to establish that forensic limitations and the nature of evidence collection can lead to misinterpretations about a suspect's involvement, while Dr. Lee acknowledges these limitations but insists that each case must be evaluated on its own merits, suggesting a more cautious approach to drawing conclusions from forensic evidence.

Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness, Dr. Lee, presented the following important claims and conflicts:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and challenges forensic scientists face, particularly regarding the identification of human remains and the limitations of forensic resources. They highlight the case of People versus Crafts to illustrate how biological evidence can be mixed and still yield results.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a nuanced disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly the implications of ""absence of evidence."" Dr. Lee agrees with the general principle but emphasizes that it varies based on specific situations, indicating that not all scenarios can be generalized.
   - The defense seeks to establish that forensic limitations and the nature of evidence collection can lead to inconclusive results, while Dr. Lee acknowledges these limitations but also stresses the importance of context in interpreting forensic evidence. This indicates a potential conflict in how evidence should be understood in relation to a suspect's involvement in a crime.

Simpson murder trial, where he questioned the handling of blood evidence. His testimony was a turning point in the trial. ","PROSECUTION: Okay. Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

25,1472,1472,1472,Q/A,"All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.",Yes.,,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"### Summary of Facts Discussed in the Dialogue

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and limitations of forensic evidence collection, particularly in cases where biological samples are mixed together. They highlight that despite these challenges, it is still possible to obtain useful DNA results, as demonstrated in the People versus Crafts case.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee acknowledges the difficulties faced by forensic scientists, including budgetary constraints and the variability of evidence collection. He agrees that the absence of blood on a suspect does not definitively indicate non-participation in a crime, as situational factors play a significant role.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreement:**
   - There is a nuanced disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly concerning the presence or absence of blood on a suspect. The defense suggests that forensic literature supports the idea that lack of blood does not imply lack of involvement, while Dr. Lee agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.
   - The defense seeks to establish that forensic science is not infallible and that conclusions drawn from evidence must consider the context, while Dr. Lee supports the notion that while evidence can be mixed and inconclusive, it can still yield valuable information when analyzed correctly. This indicates a broader conflict about the reliability and interpretation of forensic evidence in criminal cases.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness, Dr. Lee, discussed the identification of human remains in forensic cases, particularly referencing the People versus Crafts case. 

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense emphasized that despite the mixing of biological evidence from various sources (including human and animal remains), Dr. Lee and his team were able to conduct DNA testing and identify human remains in the Crafts case. They also highlighted the practical challenges forensic scientists face, such as budgetary constraints that limit the extent of testing that can be performed.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee acknowledged the challenges in forensic science, agreeing that while absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime, the context of each situation is crucial. He noted that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect's clothing can vary significantly depending on the circumstances of the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly the idea that a lack of blood on a suspect does not necessarily mean they did not participate in a violent crime. Dr. Lee pointed out that while this is generally true, it is highly situational and depends on the specifics of the crime scene.
   - The defense sought to establish that forensic limitations and the mixing of evidence do not preclude the possibility of identifying human remains, while Dr. Lee emphasized the variability and context-dependent nature of forensic evidence interpretation, suggesting that conclusions cannot be universally applied without considering the specifics of each case.

For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.",,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"### Summary of Facts Discussed in the Dialogue

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and limitations of forensic evidence collection, particularly in cases where biological samples are mixed together. They highlight that despite the challenges, DNA technology was still applied in the past, even when evidence was not pristine.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee acknowledges the difficulties faced by forensic scientists, including budgetary constraints and the variability of evidence collection. He agrees that the absence of blood on a suspect does not definitively indicate non-participation in a crime, as situational factors can influence the presence of blood spatter.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly concerning the implications of not finding blood on a suspect. The defense argues that absence of blood does not equate to absence of involvement in a crime, while Dr. Lee supports this notion but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.
   - The defense also seeks to clarify the methodology used in past cases, particularly the Crafts case, and how mixed biological evidence was handled. Dr. Lee confirms that while some evidence was mixed, they were still able to identify human remains, which the defense uses to argue for the reliability of forensic methods despite challenges. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the complexities of forensic science and the nuances involved in interpreting evidence in criminal cases.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and limitations of forensic evidence collection, particularly in cases where biological samples are mixed and the challenges posed by budgetary constraints in forensic science. They are also highlighting the idea that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee, the forensic expert, acknowledges the challenges in forensic science, including the mixing of biological samples and the limitations of technology at the time of the Crafts case. He agrees that the absence of blood does not definitively prove a suspect's non-involvement, but he also emphasizes that the context of the crime scene is crucial in determining expectations for blood evidence.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly concerning the implications of not finding blood on a suspect. The defense suggests that this absence does not rule out involvement, while Dr. Lee agrees but insists that the situation must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
   - The defense is trying to establish that forensic scientists often face limitations that can affect their conclusions, while Dr. Lee acknowledges these limitations but also stresses the importance of context in forensic analysis, indicating that not all scenarios are the same.
   - The defense's questioning implies a critique of the forensic methods used in past cases, while Dr. Lee defends the validity of the methods employed, even when faced with mixed biological evidence.

D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and limitations of forensic evidence collection, particularly in cases where biological samples are mixed and the challenges posed by budgetary constraints in forensic science. They highlight that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime, as situational factors can affect blood spatter.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee supports the defense's assertion that forensic scientists face challenges in evidence collection and analysis due to resource limitations. He agrees that the absence of blood does not definitively prove a lack of involvement in a crime, but he also emphasizes that the context of the crime scene is crucial in determining expectations for blood evidence.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly concerning the implications of not finding blood on a suspect. While the defense argues that this absence does not imply non-involvement, Dr. Lee acknowledges that it depends on the specific circumstances of the crime scene, suggesting a nuanced view rather than a blanket statement.
   - The defense and Dr. Lee also discuss specific cases, such as the People versus Crafts and People versus Hoeplinger, where the nature of the crime and the resulting blood evidence are examined. Dr. Lee's recollection of the details in these cases sometimes differs from the defense's framing, indicating potential conflicts in how the evidence and circumstances are understood.

D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

They argue that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime, as various factors can influence blood spatter and evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee supports the defense's assertion that forensic science literature cautions against inferring non-participation based solely on the absence of blood. He acknowledges that the context of the crime scene, such as distance and the nature of the assault, plays a crucial role in determining whether blood would be found on a suspect.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the specifics of evidence collection and the interpretation of blood evidence in different scenarios. The defense highlights that in some cases, like the Hoeplinger case, despite a bloody crime scene, the suspect had minimal blood on their clothing, which raises questions about the reliability of blood evidence as an indicator of guilt.
   - Dr. Lee agrees with the defense's general points but also emphasizes that the situation's specifics can lead to different outcomes regarding blood spatter and evidence presence. He notes that while more blood typically leads to more blood on the suspect, various factors can alter this expectation, indicating a nuanced understanding of forensic evidence that may not align perfectly with the defense's broader claims.

D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that that kind of an assault with the brick on the head by beating numerous times produces enormous amount of blood and it did so in the Hoeplinger case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that on the suspect's jeans, there were only two drops of blood?
D_WITNESS: Well, we assume that's the original jean. I don't have any record, but I do know he wash his T-shirt. I found a T-shirt washed in the pond.

If you say correct, probably correct. I don't recall. There's thousands cases I been working on.",,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"### Summary of Facts Discussed in the Dialogue

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the challenges forensic scientists face, particularly regarding the limitations of evidence collection and the interpretation of blood evidence. They argue that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime, as various factors can influence blood spatter and evidence collection.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee, the forensic witness, supports the defense's assertion that the absence of blood does not definitively prove a lack of involvement in a crime. He acknowledges that the context of the crime scene, the distance from the victim, and the nature of the assault can all affect whether a suspect would have blood on them.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the specifics of evidence collection and the interpretation of mixed biological samples. The defense questions the reliability of the evidence collected in the past, particularly in the People versus Crafts case, where biological evidence was mixed with other materials.
   - The defense also challenges Dr. Lee's recollection of the People versus Hoeplinger case, particularly regarding the amount of blood found on the suspect's clothing. Dr. Lee confirms that there were only two drops of blood on the suspect's jeans, which raises questions about the suspect's involvement given the violent nature of the crime.
   - Additionally, there is a nuanced discussion about the variability of blood spatter evidence based on the circumstances of the crime, with Dr. Lee indicating that while more blood is generally expected in close-contact situations, there are exceptions based on the specifics of each case. This highlights the complexity and potential for differing interpretations in forensic science.

D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that that kind of an assault with the brick on the head by beating numerous times produces enormous amount of blood and it did so in the Hoeplinger case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that on the suspect's jeans, there were only two drops of blood?
D_WITNESS: Well, we assume that's the original jean. I don't have any record, but I do know he wash his T-shirt. I found a T-shirt washed in the pond.

PROSECUTION: Right.
D_WITNESS: But the blue jean, whether or not that's the original blue jean, I have no or information, record of it.

PROSECUTION: Well, you testified in court and those blue jeans were presented to a jury as being worn by the suspects--suspect, the husband at the time of the murder; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I--that's long time ago. If you say correct, probably correct. I don't recall. There's thousands cases I been working on.

PROSECUTION: Does that seem to be consistent with your memory?

35,1482,1482,1482,Q/A,And only two blood drops?,"I don't remember. If you say two drops, it's two drop.",,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"### Summary of Facts Discussed in the Dialogue

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness, Dr. Lee, discussed the identification of human remains in forensic cases, particularly referencing the People versus Crafts case and the People versus Hoeplinger case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the challenges forensic scientists face, such as budgetary constraints and the complexities of collecting and analyzing biological evidence, especially when it is mixed with other materials. They highlighted that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee acknowledged the difficulties in forensic science, agreeing that while it is possible to identify human remains even when biological evidence is mixed, the context of each case is crucial. He also confirmed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect's clothing can vary significantly based on the circumstances of the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement regarding the implications of the absence of blood on a suspect. The defense argued that it cannot be conclusively inferred that a suspect did not participate in a crime solely based on a lack of blood evidence, while Dr. Lee supported this notion but emphasized that it depends on the specific situation of the crime.
   - The defense also questioned the reliability of evidence from the Hoeplinger case, where the suspect had minimal blood on his jeans despite a violent crime. Dr. Lee's recollection of the case was somewhat vague, leading to uncertainty about the evidence presented in court, which the defense used to challenge the credibility of the forensic findings.

Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness, Dr. Lee, presented the following important claims and conflicts:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and challenges forensic scientists face in identifying biological evidence, particularly in cases where evidence is mixed and scattered, as illustrated by the People versus Crafts case. They argue that despite these challenges, DNA technology was still applied to the evidence collected.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee supports the defense's assertion by confirming that while the biological evidence was mixed, it was still possible to identify human remains using the available technology at the time. He also acknowledges the limitations of forensic resources and the variability in blood spatter evidence based on the circumstances of a crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - **Identification of Evidence:** There is a conflict regarding the reliability of evidence collected from crime scenes where biological materials are mixed. The defense suggests that the presence of mixed evidence does not preclude the possibility of identifying human remains, while Dr. Lee agrees but emphasizes that the context of each case is crucial.
   - **Blood Evidence in Crimes:** The defense questions the expectation of finding blood on a suspect's clothing after a violent crime, citing specific cases (like People versus Hoeplinger) where the suspect had minimal blood on their clothing despite a bloody crime scene. Dr. Lee agrees that the amount of blood found on a suspect can vary significantly based on the circumstances of the crime, indicating a nuanced understanding rather than a straightforward correlation.
   - **Memory and Testimony Consistency:** The defense challenges Dr. Lee's recollection of specific details from past cases, particularly regarding the amount of blood found on the suspect's jeans in the Hoeplinger case. Dr. Lee's responses suggest uncertainty, which the defense uses to question the reliability of forensic evidence presented in court. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the complexities of forensic science, the challenges of evidence collection, and the variability of blood spatter evidence in violent crimes, while also revealing tensions between the defense's narrative and the witness's recollections.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that that kind of an assault with the brick on the head by beating numerous times produces enormous amount of blood and it did so in the Hoeplinger case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that on the suspect's jeans, there were only two drops of blood?
D_WITNESS: Well, we assume that's the original jean. I don't have any record, but I do know he wash his T-shirt. I found a T-shirt washed in the pond.

PROSECUTION: Right.
D_WITNESS: But the blue jean, whether or not that's the original blue jean, I have no or information, record of it.

PROSECUTION: Well, you testified in court and those blue jeans were presented to a jury as being worn by the suspects--suspect, the husband at the time of the murder; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I--that's long time ago. If you say correct, probably correct. I don't recall. There's thousands cases I been working on.

PROSECUTION: Does that seem to be consistent with your memory?
D_WITNESS: Sure. Sure.

PROSECUTION: And only two blood drops?
D_WITNESS: I don't remember. If you say two drops, it's two drop.

PROSECUTION: And the scene was covered in blood, correct?

37,1484,1484,1484,Q/A,"Sir, if a person were to wrap their hand around someone's throat and slit that person's throat--","Yes, sir.",,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"### Summary of Facts Discussed in the Dialogue

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness, Dr. Lee, discussed the identification of human remains in forensic cases, particularly referencing the People versus Crafts case and the People versus Hoeplinger case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense emphasized the challenges forensic scientists face, such as budgetary constraints and the complexities of evidence collection, particularly when biological samples are mixed together. They highlighted that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee acknowledged the difficulties in forensic science, agreeing that while absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation, the presence of blood on a suspect can vary significantly based on the circumstances of the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement regarding the implications of blood evidence. The defense argued that forensic literature cautions against inferring non-participation based solely on the absence of blood, while Dr. Lee agreed but noted that the context of the crime (e.g., distance from the victim) is crucial in determining whether blood should be expected on a suspect.
   - In the Hoeplinger case, the defense pointed out that despite a bloody crime scene, the suspect had only two drops of blood on his jeans, which seemed inconsistent with the violent nature of the crime. Dr. Lee acknowledged the bloodiness of the scene but expressed uncertainty about the jeans' provenance, indicating a lack of definitive evidence regarding their condition at the time of the murder.

D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: --and the blood spurted forward, would you expect the assailant to be covered in blood?
D_WITNESS: Probably not.",simpson_defense_6,Dr. Henry Lee,"Dr. Henry Lee was a forensic scientist who testified for the defense in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, where he questioned the handling of blood evidence. His testimony was a turning point in the trial. ","PROSECUTION: Okay. Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that that kind of an assault with the brick on the head by beating numerous times produces enormous amount of blood and it did so in the Hoeplinger case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that on the suspect's jeans, there were only two drops of blood?
D_WITNESS: Well, we assume that's the original jean. I don't have any record, but I do know he wash his T-shirt. I found a T-shirt washed in the pond.

PROSECUTION: Right.
D_WITNESS: But the blue jean, whether or not that's the original blue jean, I have no or information, record of it.

PROSECUTION: Well, you testified in court and those blue jeans were presented to a jury as being worn by the suspects--suspect, the husband at the time of the murder; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I--that's long time ago. If you say correct, probably correct. I don't recall. There's thousands cases I been working on.

PROSECUTION: Does that seem to be consistent with your memory?
D_WITNESS: Sure. Sure.

PROSECUTION: And only two blood drops?
D_WITNESS: I don't remember. If you say two drops, it's two drop.

PROSECUTION: And the scene was covered in blood, correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Sir, if a person were to wrap their hand around someone's throat and slit that person's throat--
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: --and the blood spurted forward, would you expect the assailant to be covered in blood?

In the court conversation, the defense is questioning a witness about their attempts to sell audiotapes, specifically inquiring if they have sold any tapes other than those related to Fuhrman. The important claim from the defense appears to be focused on establishing the witness's credibility and potential motives for selling audiotapes. The witness's response indicates that they have not attempted to sell any other audiotapes, which may suggest a lack of ulterior motives.

The conflict arises from the defense's implication that the witness may have a financial incentive or bias related to the audiotapes, while the witness's denial aims to counter that implication. This disagreement highlights the tension between the defense's strategy to undermine the witness's reliability and the witness's attempt to maintain their integrity and credibility in the case.

In the court conversation, the key claims and conflicts from each side are as follows:

1. **Defense's Important Claim**: The defense is attempting to establish that the witness (D_WITNESS) has a contradictory stance regarding the use of a racial epithet. They argue that the witness has previously used the word in a screenplay for profit, which raises questions about the witness's credibility and their reaction to its use by Mark Fuhrman.

2. **Witness's Important Claim**: The witness maintains that they were offended by Fuhrman's use of the epithet and asserts that they did not authorize the sale of the audiotapes or transcripts. They claim that their attorneys were merely assessing the market value of the tapes, not actively seeking to sell them.

**Conflicts and Disagreements**:
- There is a significant disagreement over the witness's reaction to Fuhrman's use of the epithet. The defense suggests that the witness did not express offense at the time and did not intervene when Fuhrman used the word multiple times, while the witness insists they were offended.

- The witness expresses confusion over the adversarial nature of the questioning, indicating a perception of hostility from the defense, which the defense counters by asserting the relevance of their inquiries. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a clash between the defense's strategy to undermine the witness's credibility and the witness's attempts to assert their moral stance against the use of racially charged language.

65,1532,1532,1532,Q/A,"And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?","I have no notes of that, no.",,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present important claims and engage in conflicts regarding the examination of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasizes that the doctor lacks independent verification of Mr. Simpson's honesty during the examination and questions the reliability of the doctor's report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and symptoms.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness asserts that his report is based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations, acknowledging that he considered the possibility of Mr. Simpson having a motive to lie.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented important claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately document or evaluate Mr. Simpson's condition during the examination on June 15th, suggesting that the doctor's conclusions may be based on incomplete or unreliable information provided by Mr. Simpson.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his report is based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations, asserting that he did not find evidence of an acute arthritic problem or any physical limitations that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the credibility of the doctor's findings, highlighting the absence of specific observations in the report, such as Mr. Simpson's gait and the results of a grip strength test. The defense suggests that the doctor had opportunities to conduct further examinations but did not do so.
   - The witness disagrees with the defense's interpretation of his findings, asserting that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic rather than acute. The doctor also refutes the defense's claim that he found no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, indicating a disagreement on the nature of Mr. Simpson's medical condition.
   - Additionally, the defense raises the possibility that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to mislead the doctor about his symptoms, while the witness acknowledges the potential for patients to be less than candid but insists that his evaluation was thorough based on the information available to him.

   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his report is based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there was no evidence of an acute arthritic problem during the examination on June 15th.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenges the doctor's lack of notes and the absence of certain findings in his report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and the need for further examination. They argue that the doctor should have considered the possibility that Mr. Simpson might not have been truthful about his symptoms.
   - The witness disagrees with the defense's interpretation of his findings, insisting that he did not find any acute issues that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime. The defense also questions the doctor's methods and whether he conducted all appropriate tests, such as the grip strength test, which the doctor claims was not typical for the examination conducted. 
   - Additionally, there is a disagreement about the nature of injuries that could be caused by a knife versus glass, with the doctor acknowledging that both types of injuries can mimic each other, which the defense uses to cast doubt on the doctor's conclusions.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately document or conduct a thorough examination of Mr. Simpson, suggesting that the doctor relied too heavily on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms without independent verification. They emphasize that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit acute symptoms that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that while Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement, he did not find evidence of an acute arthritic problem on the date of examination.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination, pointing out the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and the lack of documentation regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and physical limitations. They suggest that the doctor failed to consider the possibility that Mr. Simpson might have been dishonest about his symptoms.
   - The witness counters that he conducted a proper evaluation and that certain findings, such as the absence of enlarged lymph nodes and the chronic nature of Mr. Simpson's orthopedic issues, were consistent with his conclusions. The doctor also disagrees with the defense's assertion that he found no evidence of acute arthritic problems, indicating a difference in interpretation of the medical findings.
   - Additionally, there is a discussion about the potential for knife cuts to mimic glass cuts, which further complicates the defense's argument regarding the nature of injuries related to the alleged crime.

D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?

89,1556,1556,1556,Q/A,"You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?",That is absolutely correct.,,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts and disagreements.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor���s examination of Mr. Simpson was inadequate and that the doctor relied too heavily on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms without independent verification. They emphasize that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit any acute arthritic problems that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there were no physical limitations that would have prevented him from committing the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the credibility of the doctor's report, pointing out that certain observations (like Mr. Simpson's gait) were not documented in the report and suggesting that the doctor may have overlooked important tests (like the grip strength test).
   - The witness acknowledges that he did not have independent verification of Mr. Simpson's truthfulness but insists that his conclusions were based on the information he gathered during the examination.
   - There is a disagreement regarding the presence of acute arthritic problems, with the defense asserting that the doctor found no evidence of such issues, while the doctor refutes this claim.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's understanding of symptoms related to sweating and fever, suggesting that the doctor did not consider all possible causes for Mr. Simpson's symptoms, while the doctor maintains that various factors could contribute to sweating, including physical activity. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a significant conflict between the defense's portrayal of the doctor's examination as flawed and the doctor's defense of his professional assessment and conclusions.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?

92,1559,1559,1559,Q/A,"Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?","I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.",,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the key claims and conflicts from both sides are as follows:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is questioning the credibility and thoroughness of the witness's examination of Mr. Simpson, emphasizing that the witness did not document certain observations or conduct specific tests that could have been relevant to Mr. Simpson's condition. They argue that the witness's report lacks critical details and that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit acute symptoms that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintains that their report is based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and their observations during the examination. They assert that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there was no evidence of an acute arthritic problem at the time of the examination.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the thoroughness of the examination conducted on June 15th. The defense points out the absence of notes and specific tests (like the grip strength test) in the report, suggesting that the witness did not adequately assess Mr. Simpson's condition.
   - The defense also questions the witness's assumption that Mr. Simpson was truthful during the examination, highlighting the possibility that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to misrepresent his symptoms.
   - The witness and the defense disagree on the interpretation of Mr. Simpson's physical condition, particularly regarding whether he had any limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime. The witness states there were no findings that would indicate such limitations, while the defense implies that the witness's conclusions are not supported by thorough examination or documentation.

D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?

That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?","Yes, it is.",,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present their important claims and highlight their conflicts and disagreements.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately evaluate Mr. Simpson's condition during the examination on June 15th, as he failed to document significant findings and did not conduct necessary tests that could have provided more insight into Mr. Simpson's health.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations, asserting that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there was no evidence of an acute arthritic problem at the time of the examination.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the credibility of the doctor's report, pointing out that certain observations (like Mr. Simpson's gait) were not included in the report and suggesting that the doctor may have overlooked important symptoms or findings.
   - The witness acknowledges that he considered the possibility of Mr. Simpson lying about his symptoms but insists that his conclusions were based on the information he received and his observations.
   - There is a disagreement regarding the necessity of further examinations or referrals to specialists, with the defense suggesting that the doctor should have pursued additional evaluations given the chronic nature of Mr. Simpson's orthopedic issues.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson's physical limitations would not prevent him from committing a violent act, while the doctor maintains that there were no findings that would indicate otherwise.
   - The defense emphasizes the subjective nature of medical interpretation, suggesting that the doctor's conclusions may not be entirely reliable, while the doctor defends his role as a medical professional focused on patient care rather than advocacy.

   - **Defense:** The defense argues that the witness, a doctor, did not adequately document or conduct necessary tests during the examination of Mr. Simpson on June 15th, 1994. They emphasize that the doctor���s report lacks critical observations regarding Mr. Simpson's physical condition and that he had no independent basis to assess Mr. Simpson's truthfulness about his symptoms.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and the absence of specific findings in his report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and the need for further orthopedic evaluation. They highlight that the doctor did not find any acute issues that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?

96,1563,1563,1563,Q/A,"Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?",I don't have a copy of that.,,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the key claims and conflicts from both sides are as follows:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense argues that the witness, a doctor, did not adequately document or evaluate Mr. Simpson's condition during the examination on June 15th. They emphasize that the doctor���s report lacks critical observations regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and physical limitations that could relate to the charges against him. The defense also suggests that the doctor failed to consider the possibility that Mr. Simpson might have had a motive to misrepresent his symptoms.
   - **Witness (Doctor):** The doctor maintains that his report is based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there was no evidence of an acute arthritic problem at the time of the examination. The doctor also states that he did not find any physical limitations that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and accuracy of the doctor's examination and report. The defense questions the absence of specific tests and observations in the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's grip strength and gait, while the doctor defends his methods and the subjective nature of some medical evaluations.
   - The defense challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit acute symptoms, arguing that the doctor had no independent basis to assess Mr. Simpson's truthfulness during the examination. The doctor, in turn, insists that he acted as a physician and not as an advocate for Mr. Simpson, emphasizing the subjective nature of medical interpretation.
   - The defense also highlights the time elapsed since Mr. Simpson's last medical examination, suggesting that the doctor���s assessment may not be fully informed, while the doctor maintains that he conducted a proper evaluation based on the information available to him at the time.

D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts and disagreements:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately evaluate Mr. Simpson's condition and that his findings were based solely on Mr. Simpson's potentially biased self-reported history. They emphasize that the doctor failed to conduct certain tests that could have provided more objective data regarding Mr. Simpson's health.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The doctor maintains that his examination and report were thorough and based on his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson. He asserts that he did not find any acute issues that would have prevented Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the credibility of the doctor's findings, pointing out that he did not document certain observations (like Mr. Simpson's gait) in his report and did not conduct additional tests that could have been relevant.
   - The witness acknowledges the limitations of his examination but insists that he did not find evidence of acute arthritic problems. The defense counters this by suggesting that the doctor should have considered the possibility of Mr. Simpson lying about his symptoms and that the doctor's subjective evaluations were insufficient.
   - There is a disagreement over whether the doctor acted as an advocate for Mr. Simpson, with the defense suggesting that he may have been biased in his assessment, while the doctor insists he was simply fulfilling his role as a physician without any intent to advocate for the defendant. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a significant tension between the defense's skepticism of the doctor's methods and conclusions and the doctor's defense of his professional conduct and findings.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?

Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not conduct a thorough examination of Mr. Simpson and that his findings were based solely on the patient's self-reported history, which could be unreliable. They emphasize that the doctor failed to document significant observations and did not perform certain tests that could have provided more objective data regarding Mr. Simpson's condition.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that he conducted a proper examination and based his report on both the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit any acute arthritic problems at the time of the examination and that his role was to provide medical care, not to advocate for Mr. Simpson in the legal context.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and the validity of his findings. The defense questions the absence of specific tests and notes in the doctor's report, suggesting that this undermines the credibility of his conclusions.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that he had no physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime. The witness counters that his findings were based on a lack of acute symptoms and chronic issues that did not require immediate intervention.
   - Additionally, the defense highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations, arguing that the doctor's assessments were not sufficiently objective, while the doctor insists that he acted within the norms of medical practice and did not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson in the legal sense.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts and disagreements:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense aimed to establish that the doctor's examination of Mr. Simpson was inadequate and that the doctor had no independent basis to evaluate Mr. Simpson's truthfulness regarding his symptoms. They emphasized that the doctor did not find any acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement at the time of the examination.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The doctor maintained that his report was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his observations during the examination. He acknowledged that while he did not find evidence of an acute arthritic problem, he did not rule out the possibility of chronic issues.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questioned the doctor's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, pointing out that he had no notes from the initial examination and that certain tests (like the grip strength test) were not performed. The defense argued that the doctor's subjective evaluations were insufficient to support his conclusions.
   - The witness disagreed with the defense's interpretation of his findings, asserting that he had not found any physical limitations that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime. The doctor also clarified that he did not consider himself an advocate for Mr. Simpson, which the defense seemed to imply was a conflict of interest.
   - There was a specific disagreement regarding the doctor's interpretation of Mr. Simpson's night sweats and their potential relevance to the case, with the defense suggesting that the doctor was trying to align his findings with the defense's narrative. The doctor, however, insisted that his observations were truthful and based on medical evaluations rather than an attempt to support Mr. Simpson's defense.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?

Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.","In a stationary situation, yes.",,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical evaluation and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately assess Mr. Simpson's physical condition and that there were no findings that would prevent him from committing the crime. They emphasize that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there was no evidence of an acute arthritic problem at the time of the examination.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his observations. He acknowledges that while he did not find acute issues, he did not rule out the possibility of Mr. Simpson having some physical limitations.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenges the doctor's lack of notes and the absence of specific findings in his report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and grip strength. They argue that the doctor���s subjective evaluations were insufficient and that he failed to conduct necessary tests.
   - The witness contends that he did not find any acute issues during the examination and that his report reflects the findings accurately. He also states that he did not consider himself an advocate for Mr. Simpson, which the defense implies could affect the objectivity of his evaluation.
   - There is a disagreement over whether the doctor should have conducted further tests or referred Mr. Simpson to a specialist, with the defense suggesting that the doctor���s inaction undermines the credibility of his findings. The doctor, however, argues that the orthopedic issues were chronic and not acute, thus not requiring immediate referral. 

Overall, the conversation highlights a significant conflict between the defense's assertion of inadequate medical evaluation and the witness's defense of his professional assessment and methodology.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any acute arthritic problems that would prevent him from committing the crime, emphasizing that the doctor found no evidence of a need for a knee replacement and that Mr. Simpson's orthopedic issues were chronic rather than acute.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic issues, he did not find any physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. However, he also indicated that there were no acute symptoms observed during the examination.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenges the doctor's examination methods and the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) in the report, suggesting that the doctor's conclusions may be subjective and not fully supported by objective evidence.
   - The witness admits to the subjective nature of some evaluations but maintains that he based his report on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his observations. The defense questions the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms, suggesting he may have had a motive to mislead the doctor.
   - There is a disagreement over the doctor's role, with the defense implying that he acted as an advocate for Mr. Simpson, while the doctor insists he was merely fulfilling his role as a physician without any intent to prepare a defense for the charges against him. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the tension between the defense's attempt to undermine the credibility of the medical evaluation and the witness's insistence on the validity of his findings based on his professional judgment.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

D_WITNESS: That is correct.

D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?

D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the witness's examination of Mr. Simpson was flawed due to a lack of thorough documentation and that the witness did not adequately consider the possibility that Mr. Simpson might have had a motive to misrepresent his symptoms. They emphasize that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit any acute arthritic problems that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintains that his medical evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his findings were consistent with chronic orthopedic issues rather than acute ones.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenges the witness on the absence of specific findings in his report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and grip strength, suggesting that the witness's conclusions were subjective and not adequately supported by objective tests.
   - The witness acknowledges that some aspects of medical evaluation can be subjective but insists that he acted as a doctor rather than an advocate for Mr. Simpson, which the defense disputes by suggesting that the witness's statements could be interpreted as supportive of Mr. Simpson's defense.
   - There is a disagreement over whether Mr. Simpson's physical condition would have allowed him to commit the alleged acts of violence, with the defense asserting that he had the physical capability to do so, while the witness confirms that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife but does not explicitly address the broader implications of his physical strength in the context of the alleged crime.

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any acute arthritic problems that would prevent him from committing the crime, emphasizing that the doctor found no evidence of a need for a knee replacement and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to pull back a victim's hair.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The witness maintains that his evaluation of Mr. Simpson was based on the history provided by the patient and his observations, asserting that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged acts.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and objectivity of the doctor's examination. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and notes that the doctor did not document certain observations in his report, suggesting a lack of comprehensive evaluation.
   - The defense also challenges the witness on whether he considered the possibility that Mr. Simpson might have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, while the witness insists that he based his findings on the information provided by Mr. Simpson.
   - Additionally, the defense highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations, arguing that the doctor's conclusions may not be entirely reliable, while the witness maintains that he acted as a physician rather than an advocate for Mr. Simpson. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a tension between the defense's attempt to undermine the credibility of the medical evaluation and the witness's insistence on the validity of his findings based on his professional judgment.

D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?

D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.

D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?

107,1574,1574,1574,Q/A,"Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?","I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.",,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately assess Mr. Simpson's physical condition and that there is no evidence to suggest he was physically incapable of committing the alleged crime. They emphasize that the doctor���s report lacks critical details about Mr. Simpson's gait and grip strength, and they question the doctor's reliance on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic rather than acute, indicating that Mr. Simpson was physically capable of performing actions related to the alleged crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and the validity of his findings. The defense points out that the doctor did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - The defense also questions the doctor's interpretation of Mr. Simpson's symptoms, suggesting that the doctor may have been biased or failed to consider that Mr. Simpson might have had a motive to misrepresent his condition.
   - The doctor, on the other hand, insists that he acted as a medical professional without bias and that his conclusions were based on the information available to him at the time of the examination. He also clarifies that he did not see it as his responsibility to prepare a defense for Mr. Simpson against the charges. 

Overall, the conversation highlights a significant conflict between the defense's portrayal of the doctor's evaluation as inadequate and the doctor's defense of his professional judgment and findings.

D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?

D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any acute physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the crime, emphasizing that the doctor found no evidence of an acute arthritic problem during his examination on June 15th, 1994. They also highlight that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to perform actions necessary for the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute problems that would prevent him from committing the crime. However, he also indicates that his report was based on Mr. Simpson's history and observations, and he admits that medical evaluations can be subjective.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and accuracy of the doctor's examination and report. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and notes that the doctor did not document certain observations in his report, suggesting a lack of diligence.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that he did not consider Mr. Simpson's potential motive to lie about his symptoms, implying that this could affect the credibility of the doctor's findings.
   - The witness maintains that he did not see a need for further orthopedic evaluation after June 15th, which the defense disputes, arguing that the doctor should have sought additional opinions given the context of the case.
   - The defense attempts to portray the doctor as an advocate for Mr. Simpson, while the doctor insists that he was merely fulfilling his role as a physician without any intention to influence the legal proceedings.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?

"
109,1576,1576,1576,Q/A,"Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?",I'm not conducting the Defense.,,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts and disagreements.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense aimed to establish that the witness's examination of Mr. Simpson was flawed due to a lack of thorough documentation and objective testing. They emphasized that the doctor had no independent basis to evaluate Mr. Simpson's truthfulness regarding his symptoms and that he did not find any acute issues that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintained that he conducted a thorough examination based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserted that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic rather than acute.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenged the witness on the absence of specific findings in his report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and the grip strength test, arguing that the witness's subjective evaluations were insufficient.
   - There was a disagreement over whether Mr. Simpson had any physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. The witness stated that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the crime, while the defense sought to portray him as having significant limitations.
   - The defense also questioned the witness's role, asserting that he should have been more of an advocate for Mr. Simpson, while the witness insisted that his responsibility was solely to provide medical care and not to prepare a defense for the charges against him. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to undermine the credibility of the witness's findings and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical assessments.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the crime, emphasizing that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems during his examination and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to perform the actions described in the crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his observations, asserting that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not exhibit any acute conditions that would have hindered his physical capabilities at the time of the alleged crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and accuracy of the doctor's examination and report. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and notes that the doctor did not document certain observations in his report, suggesting a lack of diligence in assessing Mr. Simpson's condition.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that he did not consider Mr. Simpson's potential motive to lie about his symptoms, implying that this could affect the credibility of the doctor's findings.
   - Additionally, the defense argues that the doctor should have consulted with Mr. Simpson's orthopedist for a more specialized opinion on his orthopedic limitations, while the doctor insists that he did not see a need for such a consultation based on his assessment.
   - The witness's role as Mr. Simpson's doctor is also scrutinized, with the defense suggesting that the doctor should have been more proactive in preparing a defense for Mr. Simpson, which the doctor denies, stating that he was simply fulfilling his role as a physician.

Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?

D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?

If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.",,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the crime, emphasizing that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems during his examination and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to perform the actions described in the allegations.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintains that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute conditions that would have impaired his ability to commit the crime. However, he also acknowledges that his evaluation was based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history and that he did not conduct certain tests that could have provided more objective data.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and objectivity of the doctor's examination. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and notes that the doctor did not document certain observations in his report, suggesting a lack of rigor in the evaluation.
   - The witness admits to the subjective nature of some of his assessments but insists that he acted as Mr. Simpson's doctor rather than an advocate for his defense. The defense counters this by pointing out that the witness's findings could be interpreted in a way that supports Mr. Simpson's innocence.
   - The defense also highlights that Mr. Simpson had not seen any other doctors for eleven months prior to the examination, which raises questions about the reliability of the witness's conclusions based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. The witness acknowledges this gap but maintains that he gathered all available medical records for context. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a complex interplay between medical evaluation and legal defense, with both sides presenting their interpretations of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities in relation to the charges against him.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?

   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts and disagreements as follows:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime. They emphasize that the doctor���s examination did not reveal acute issues that would impair Mr. Simpson's ability to perform actions such as holding a knife or pulling someone's hair.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation of Mr. Simpson was based on the history provided by the patient and his observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find evidence of acute problems during the examination on June 15th.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the thoroughness and objectivity of the doctor's examination, pointing out that he did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more definitive evidence regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities. The doctor admits that some evaluations were subjective and that he did not have the necessary equipment for certain tests.
   - There is a disagreement over whether Mr. Simpson had a motive to misrepresent his symptoms during the examination. The defense suggests that the doctor had no independent basis to assess Mr. Simpson's truthfulness, while the doctor acknowledges the possibility of deceit but insists his report was based on the information provided by Mr. Simpson.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's decision not to refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist after the examination, arguing that it would have been more appropriate for a specialist to evaluate any orthopedic limitations. The doctor defends his decision by stating that there were no acute reasons for such a referral.
   - Finally, the defense highlights inconsistencies in the doctor's findings, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's physical condition on June 12th compared to June 15th, suggesting that if witnesses observed no limitations on June 12th, it contradicts the doctor's observations made three days later. The doctor acknowledges this potential inconsistency but maintains that he observed a limp during his examination.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
"
115,1582,1582,1582,Q/A,"And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.",Absolutely well-muscled.,,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the crime, emphasizing that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert strength necessary to commit the alleged acts.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform certain actions, he also admits that his evaluation was based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history and observations, which could be subjective. The doctor does not definitively rule out the possibility of Mr. Simpson having physical limitations.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the doctor's evaluation methods and the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like a grip strength test) and the lack of independent verification of Mr. Simpson's claims, suggesting that the doctor may have been misled by Mr. Simpson's presentation.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson had a limp during the examination, proposing that he could have been faking it. The doctor acknowledges this possibility but maintains that he observed a limp.
   - Additionally, the defense highlights that the doctor did not refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist for further evaluation, suggesting that the doctor's assessment may not be comprehensive or authoritative in the context of orthopedic issues. The doctor defends his position by stating that there were no acute reasons for such a referral based on his findings. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a complex interplay of medical evaluation, subjective interpretation, and the implications of physical limitations in the context of the case against Mr. Simpson.

He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's physical condition and its implications for the case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime. They emphasize that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had some physical issues, he did not find any evidence of acute problems on June 15th. However, he also admits that his evaluation was based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history and observations, which could be subjective.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the reliability of the doctor's evaluation, particularly regarding whether Mr. Simpson had a motive to misrepresent his symptoms. The defense suggests that the doctor did not adequately consider the possibility of Mr. Simpson faking his condition.
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and whether he should have referred Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, given the chronic nature of his issues. The doctor maintains that there was no acute need for such a referral.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's subjective assessments, such as grip strength and the presence of a limp, suggesting that these could be exaggerated or fabricated by Mr. Simpson. The doctor concedes that subjective interpretation plays a role in medical evaluations.
   - Finally, the defense points out that the doctor did not have recent medical records to support his findings, as Mr. Simpson had not seen a doctor for eleven months prior to the examination, raising questions about the accuracy of the doctor's conclusions.

Recent Exchanges:
PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?

Did you ever ask him to run at any time?,I never asked him to run.,,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.

D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
"

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's physical condition and its relevance to the case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. They emphasize that the doctor did not find evidence of acute arthritic problems or any physical limitations that would hinder Mr. Simpson's ability to use a knife or engage in physical actions necessary for the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had some chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute problems during his examination on June 15th. However, he also admits that his evaluation was based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history and his own observations, which could be subjective.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the doctor's evaluation methods and the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. The defense questions the absence of objective tests (like a grip strength test) and the doctor's reliance on Mr. Simpson's account, suggesting that he may have had a motive to misrepresent his condition.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson could perform physical actions related to the crime, suggesting that the doctor's findings could be interpreted differently, including the possibility that Mr. Simpson was faking his symptoms.
   - Additionally, the defense points out that the doctor did not refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist for further evaluation, which they argue would have been appropriate given the circumstances. The doctor maintains that there was no acute need for such a referral based on his findings. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the tension between the subjective nature of medical evaluations and the objective requirements of the legal case, with the defense seeking to undermine the credibility of the witness's findings.

D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's physical condition and its implications for the case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson's physical limitations, particularly concerning his knee and overall mobility, would not have prevented him from committing the alleged murders. They emphasize that the doctor did not find significant acute issues during his examination and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to perform the actions described in the charges.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation of Mr. Simpson was based on the history provided by the patient and his observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find acute problems that would have prevented him from physical actions, but he also admits that his assessment was subjective and that he did not conduct certain tests that could have provided more objective data.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and objectivity of the doctor's examination. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and the lack of detailed notes, suggesting that the doctor's conclusions may not be reliable.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson could have faked a limp during the examination, implying that the doctor's observations may not accurately reflect Mr. Simpson's condition on the day of the alleged murders.
   - The witness's claim that he did not consider himself an advocate for Mr. Simpson contrasts with the defense's implication that the doctor should have been more proactive in assessing Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities in relation to the charges against him. The defense suggests that the doctor���s role should have included preparing a defense based on his findings, which the doctor denies. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the tension between the defense's portrayal of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the doctor's more cautious, subjective assessment of his condition.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?

Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. They emphasize that the doctor���s evaluations and reports do not support the notion that Mr. Simpson was incapacitated or unable to perform actions such as wielding a knife or pulling someone���s hair.

   - Lastly, the defense implies that the doctor���s role as Mr. Simpson's physician does not equate to being an advocate for him in the context of the trial, which the doctor agrees with, stating he was there to provide medical care, not to prepare a defense.

D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, during the recess, did you count the number of abrasions that you

"
121,1589,1589,1589,Q/A,And did you also count the number of cuts to his left hand?,"Yes, I did.",,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson, particularly concerning his physical capabilities and health status at the time of the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. They emphasize that the doctor did not find evidence of acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on Mr. Simpson's history and observations, and while he did not find acute issues, he acknowledged the possibility of Mr. Simpson faking symptoms. The doctor also noted that Mr. Simpson had not seen another physician for eleven months prior to the evaluation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and objectivity of the doctor's examination. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and the lack of detailed notes, suggesting that the doctor's conclusions may be subjective.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson could have performed the actions required to commit the crime, suggesting that the doctor's evaluation may not fully account for Mr. Simpson's physical condition or potential for deception.
   - The witness's claim that he did not consider Mr. Simpson's potential motive to lie during the examination is also contested, as the defense implies that this oversight could affect the validity of the doctor's findings. 

Overall, the conversation highlights a significant conflict between the defense's portrayal of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the doctor's medical assessment, raising questions about the reliability of the evaluation and the implications for the case.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson's medical condition, particularly regarding his knee and overall physical limitations, would not have prevented him from committing the murders. They emphasize that the doctor did not find any acute issues during his examination and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to commit the acts in question.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute arthritic problems during the examination. However, he acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could perform certain actions, like holding a knife, under specific conditions.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the doctor's evaluation methods and the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. The defense questions the absence of objective tests (like a grip strength test) and suggests that the doctor relied too heavily on Mr. Simpson's account without independent verification.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson exhibited a limp during the examination, suggesting that it could have been faked, which the doctor concedes is a possibility.
   - Additionally, the defense points out that Mr. Simpson had not seen a doctor for eleven months prior to the examination, questioning the relevance of the doctor's findings and whether they accurately reflect Mr. Simpson's condition at the time of the alleged crime.
   - The witness's role as Mr. Simpson's doctor is also scrutinized, with the defense suggesting that the doctor should have sought further orthopedic evaluation, while the doctor insists he was not conducting a defense for Mr. Simpson. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the tension between the defense's portrayal of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the doctor's medical assessments, leading to significant disagreements about the implications of Mr. Simpson's health on the case.

Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, during the recess, did you count the number of abrasions that you
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: How many separate abrasions did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Seven.

PROSECUTION: And did you also count the number of cuts to his left hand?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: How many did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Three cuts, one of which, on the fourth finger, had both an a and B portion.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you said that Mr. Simpson told you he got these injuries in Chicago; is that correct?
"
124,1592,1592,1592,Q/A,That he cut it on glass?,That's correct.,,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for the case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson's medical evaluations do not support the assertion that he had any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. They emphasize that the doctor did not find acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluations were based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history and his own observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find evidence of acute problems during the examination on June 15th, 1994.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms and whether he had a motive to misrepresent his condition. The defense suggests that the doctor had no independent basis to assess Mr. Simpson's truthfulness, while the doctor insists that he considered the possibility of Mr. Simpson not being candid.
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and whether he should have referred Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, arguing that the doctor���s subjective evaluations could be biased. The doctor counters that he did not find acute issues that warranted such a referral.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's conclusions about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities, suggesting that the doctor���s assessments were not comprehensive enough to rule out the possibility of Mr. Simpson being able to commit the alleged acts, especially under the influence of adrenaline.
   - Finally, there is a dispute regarding the source of Mr. Simpson's injuries, with the defense asserting that the doctor misrepresented where Mr. Simpson claimed to have sustained them. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the tension between the defense's portrayal of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the doctor's medical assessments, leading to significant conflicts in their testimonies.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, during the recess, did you count the number of abrasions that you
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: How many separate abrasions did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Seven.

PROSECUTION: And did you also count the number of cuts to his left hand?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: How many did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Three cuts, one of which, on the fourth finger, had both an a and B portion.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you said that Mr. Simpson told you he got these injuries in Chicago; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: No. That's incorrect.

126,1601,1601,1601,Q/A,"Now, doctor, you did see what you said I think originally was the commercial video?",That's correct.,,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson's medical condition, particularly regarding his knee and arthritis, would not have prevented him from committing the murders. They emphasize that the doctor found no acute issues during his examination and that Mr. Simpson could perform actions necessary for the alleged crime, such as holding a knife and pulling someone's hair.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation of Mr. Simpson was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute limitations that would prevent him from committing the crime, but he also admits that his assessment is subjective and relies on Mr. Simpson's honesty.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a significant disagreement over the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms and the doctor's interpretation of his physical capabilities. The defense suggests that Mr. Simpson may have been exaggerating or faking his symptoms, while the doctor insists that he took Mr. Simpson at his word during the examination.
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and whether he should have referred Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, arguing that the doctor���s findings were not comprehensive enough to rule out any limitations. The doctor counters that he did not find any acute issues that warranted such a referral.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson could have committed the crime, suggesting that the doctor's subjective evaluations may not accurately reflect Mr. Simpson's true physical state at the time of the alleged incident. The doctor, however, maintains that he observed a limp during his examination, which raises questions about Mr. Simpson's condition leading up to the crime. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the tension between the defense's portrayal of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the doctor's medical assessments, with both sides presenting conflicting interpretations of the evidence.

Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson's medical condition, particularly his knee and arthritis issues, would not have prevented him from committing the murders. They emphasize that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to commit the acts in question.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluations were based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history and his own observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find evidence of acute problems that would have limited his ability to commit the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a significant disagreement over the doctor's evaluation methods and the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. The defense questions the absence of detailed notes and the subjective nature of the doctor's assessments, suggesting that Mr. Simpson may have been dishonest about his condition.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's decision not to refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, arguing that it would have been more appropriate for a specialist to evaluate any orthopedic limitations.
   - Additionally, the defense raises the possibility that Mr. Simpson could have faked his symptoms during the examination, while the doctor insists that he cannot speculate on Mr. Simpson's intentions or truthfulness.
   - The conversation also touches on the doctor's role and whether he acted as an advocate for Mr. Simpson, with the doctor asserting that he was simply fulfilling his duties as a physician without any intent to influence the legal proceedings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious examination of medical evidence and its relevance to the case, highlighting the complexities of interpreting medical conditions in the context of criminal behavior.

D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, during the recess, did you count the number of abrasions that you
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: How many separate abrasions did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Seven.

PROSECUTION: And did you also count the number of cuts to his left hand?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: How many did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Three cuts, one of which, on the fourth finger, had both an a and B portion.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you said that Mr. Simpson told you he got these injuries in Chicago; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: No. That's incorrect.

PROSECUTION: That he cut it on glass?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, I want you to assume that there's been testimony received in this case that blood that was genetically tested and found to match Mr. Simpson's was found in the foyer and driveway areas of Mr. Simpson's home-- Doctor, in your opinion, would the kind of cuts that you observed in Mr.

Is that what you are suggesting.
D_WITNESS: I cannot get inside Mr. Simpson's head.

PROSECUTION: Have you in any way tried to mislead this jury based on your medical findings and observations of Mr. Simpson on June the 15th?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: And to your knowledge was Mr. Simpson treated for the last three and a half years for arthritis?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson's medical condition, particularly his knee issues and arthritis, did not prevent him from committing the murders. They emphasize that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to commit the acts in question.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation of Mr. Simpson was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged acts.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a significant disagreement over the doctor's evaluation methods and the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. The defense questions the absence of detailed notes and the subjective nature of the doctor's assessments, suggesting that Mr. Simpson may have been exaggerating or faking his symptoms.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's decision not to refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, arguing that it would have been more appropriate for a specialist to evaluate Mr. Simpson's orthopedic limitations.
   - Additionally, the defense raises the possibility that Mr. Simpson could have faked a limp during the doctor's examination, which contradicts the doctor's observations of a limp on June 15th.
   - The witness's assertion that he cannot speculate on Mr. Simpson's motivations or truthfulness adds to the tension, as the defense seeks to portray the doctor as potentially biased or lacking thoroughness in his evaluation. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the defense's strategy to undermine the credibility of the medical evaluation while asserting that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not have hindered his ability to commit the alleged crimes.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, during the recess, did you count the number of abrasions that you
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: How many separate abrasions did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Seven.

PROSECUTION: And did you also count the number of cuts to his left hand?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: How many did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Three cuts, one of which, on the fourth finger, had both an a and B portion.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you said that Mr. Simpson told you he got these injuries in Chicago; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: No. That's incorrect.

PROSECUTION: That he cut it on glass?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, I want you to assume that there's been testimony received in this case that blood that was genetically tested and found to match Mr. Simpson's was found in the foyer and driveway areas of Mr. Simpson's home-- Doctor, in your opinion, would the kind of cuts that you observed in Mr.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Doctor, you are suggesting that Mr. Simpson is not being truthful with these people regarding his medical condition because he views himself as a pitchman for a product as a result of which he is willing to say things that are not true to please the people paying him to make the speech? Is that what you are suggesting.
D_WITNESS: I cannot get inside Mr. Simpson's head.

PROSECUTION: Have you in any way tried to mislead this jury based on your medical findings and observations of Mr. Simpson on June the 15th?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: And to your knowledge was Mr. Simpson treated for the last three and a half years for arthritis?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: And do you believe that that was to set up some type of Defense for a crime that would be committed five years or four years later?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Is there any patient that you treat that would not be capable of cutting someone with a knife?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: --is your opinion any different as to whether or not Mr. Simpson had any
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Is the cut on the index finger of Mr. Simpson consistent with somebody who broke a drinking glass that you would find in a hotel bathroom?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you did see what you said I think originally was the commercial video?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And all of the aerobic exercise that we see in that type of environment is included in the commercial video. Some of what we saw because, they didn't multiple takes, is not included in the commercial video, correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And the commercial video has Mr. Simpson taking golf swings and shooting a basketball and so forth; is that correct?

In the court conversation, the defense is focused on establishing the credibility and background of Mr. Hodge, a witness who was arrested by officers Vettraino and Fuhrman. The defense claims that Mr. Hodge was involved in criminal activities as a crack dealer associated with the Playboy Gangster Crips, suggesting that his testimony may be influenced by his past. They emphasize the importance of the specific date of the arrest and the context of the alleged statement made by Officer Fuhrman.

On the other hand, the prosecution, represented by Mr. Darden, objects to the defense's line of questioning, arguing that it is beyond the scope of the current inquiry. The conflict arises from the defense's attempt to establish a timeline and context for Mr. Hodge's arrest while the prosecution seeks to limit the discussion to relevant facts without delving into Mr. Hodge's criminal history or the specifics of his past interactions with the police. The disagreement centers on the relevance of Mr. Hodge's background and the implications of the alleged statement made by Officer Fuhrman during the arrest.
