Q/A,Please state your name for the Court.,Richard Ofshe.,,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,"And what do you do for a living, Mr. Ofshe?",I'm a professor of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley.,,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Okay. Can you tell the Court and the jury a little about about your education and background?,"I received a Bachelor's Degree in psychology from Queens College of the City University of New York, and then a Master's Degree in sociology from the same institution, and then a Ph.D. in the sociology department of Stanford University with a specialty in a sub-field called social psychology.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Would you explain to the Court and the Jury what social psychology is?,"Social psychology is a specialty area that is found both within psychology and within sociology. It has to do principally and particularly the part that I specialize in -- it has to do with influence, decision making, belief, and attitude change, techniques of pressure and coercion and I specialize particularly extraordinary techniques control and influences.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Do you have any experience or training in the area of influence and more specifically in the area of influence with regard to police interrogation?,"All my work for the last thirty years or more has been on the subject of influence starting out doing work in traditional problems -- excuse me -- traditional problems in social psychology having to do with decision making, group influence, interpersonal influence. Then starting about the early part of the nineteen seventies I became interested in complex real world systems of influence. That is to say not laboratory research, but rather studying on-going very complicated influence environments and particularly those kinds of environments that have massive effects on individuals. So initially I did a lot of work for about ten or twelve years studying what are called cult groups. That is to say groups that are very strongly organized, that exert enormous pressure on individuals and that can lead individuals to change the way in which they see the world and be willing to take part in activities that they otherwise would ordinarily not take part in. During -- and I specialized in studying cult groups that generate violence. During that period of time I did a great deal of work often involving the analysis of groups that led their followers to commit murders. I did a lot of work for prosecutorial agencies, analyzing and prosecuting such crimes. Then my interest in influence continued and I began to become interested in the study of police interrogation. Ah, police interrogation is the root of -- out of which various studied round the world procedures of influence groups -particularly techniques that have to do with coercing confessions from individuals and generally manipulating them in extraordinary ways. And that work began in the late nineteen eighties and since then I've done a great deal of work and written about police interrogation tactics, in particular police interrogations that can and does lead to coerced and/or false confessions.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,"Has any of your work been published, Doctor Ofshe?","Yes. I've published four or five books, and thirty or more articles in scientific journals, and presented papers at dozens of conferences over the years. The work on all of these subjects have been published.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Are you familiar with a Doctor Gudjonsson?,"Yes, I am.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,And how are you familiar with his work?,He's one of the other people who is a specialist in techniques of interrogation and influencing police interrogations.,,Defense,D_WITNESS
Interruption,"Your Honor, at this time if I may interrupt, as I understood it he is qualifying him as -or in the process of qualifying him as an expert. They're moving on to another area and I'd ask that I'd have an opportunity to voir dire the witness regarding his special qualifications.",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,Well---,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Your Honor, I asked him about what has been published.",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,You're-asking about somebody else's work.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Your Honor, I was---",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Right now if you're' qualifying him, then-- then go through his qualification, his vitae, and then pass him, and then if they've got any questions, then I'm going to allow them to voir dire.",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"I think my next question will clear this up, your Honor.",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,All right.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Q/A,"Are you mentioned in Doctor Gudjonsson's book, ""The Psychology of Interrogations, Confessions, and Testimony""?","My work is discussed in that book, yes.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Did you contribute to the book in any form or fashion?,"Well, he asked me to review certain chapters of the book and I reviewed them, and made comments, and then he thanked me in the introduction for doing that, and then he also discusses my work in the substance of the book.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,"I also understand, Doctor Ofshe, that you've won a Pulitzer Prize?","I shared in the nineteen seventy-nine Pulitzer Prize for public service, yes.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,"And what was that for-- I mean, what was the subject of your---","That was for work I did with the publisher of small weekly newspaper in West Marin County, California. We did an expose of a group called Synanon which started out as a drug rehabilitation. organization and. turned into a violent cult group that was assaulting and attempting to murder people in the immediate area. It became quite a major subject and that year we were lucky enough to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Are you a member of any professional associations?,"Yes. I'm a member of the American Psychological Association, the American Sociological Association, the American Psychological Society, the Sociologic Practice Association, and the Pacific Sociologic Association.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Have you ever served as a consultant to any law enforcement agencies?,"Oh, yes, I have. Starting in nineteen seventy-nine I served as consultant to Marin County Sheriff's Department and then subsequent to that the office of the Attorney General of the State of California, the office of the Attorney General of the state of Arizona, the United States Department of Justice -- both the tax division and the criminal division -- the Prosecuting Attorney of Jefferson County, West Virginia, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office, the Internal -- that's not a law enforcement agency, I guess. The United States Attorney's office in West Virginia, the Thurston County, Washington, prosecutor's office, currently the State's Attorney's office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and again for the United States Attorney's office in West Virginia'",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Have you ever testified on behalf of the prosecution in a criminal case?,I don't believe -- I'll have to look at the list of cases in which I've testified.,,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,"Well, I'll go on to the next question. Do you lecture to groups regarding the influence of police tactics in false confessions?","Yes, I do. I'm -- in fact I've been asked to -- in May of this year to -- at the request of the Supreme Court of the State of Florida -- been asked to address for a half day a judicial conference in Florida on the subject of false confessions.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Have you been involved in both civil and criminal cases dealing with false confessions and confessions in general?,"Yes, I have.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,How many -- excuse me -- how many cases dealing with confessions have you been involved in?,"Confessions specifically thirteen -- I've testified thirteen separate times. I've been involved in many more cases. Much of the work that I do is consulting work that doesn't necessarily culminate in testimony. That's why I wasn't certain whether I had actually testified in this criminal matter. I'm scheduled to the week after next, but I can't at this moment think of another example where I already have.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Okay. Have you testified in court with regard to any confessions taken on the defense side? ....,"Yes. Most -- most of the confession cases in which I've testified have been cases involving coerced or coerced false confessions and, therefore, my testimony has been principally for the defense in those cases.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
interruption,How many times have you been qualified as an expert in the area of influence and police interrogation? A. Twenty-five times.,,,Defense,
Q/A,Twenty-five times? In both state and federal courts?,"Yes, sir.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Interruption,"Your Honor, if I might -- the question was: Qualified as an expert in the area of influence and police interrogations -- can we break that down? I didn't hear anything in the background as far as police interrogation.",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,Can you break it down?,,THE COURT,COURT,
Q/A,Have you been qualified as a expert by any court in the area of police interrogation tactics and influence on individuals during police interrogations tactics?,Yes. On influence in police interrogation in particular I've qualified and testified thirteen times. On influence in general I've been qualified and testified an additional twelve times making a total of twenty-five.,,Defense,D_WITNESS
interruption,Okay. Have these been in both state and federal courts?,,,Defense,
Q/A,Have you ever testified in the State of Arkansas?,"Yes, I have.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,And where was that at?,"In Fort Smith in federal court in a case brought by a young man and his family against a person named Tony Alamo who ran a cult group located in Fort Smith, and the case had to do with the beating of this child.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Interruption,"Your Honor, at this time we would ask that the witness be qualified as an expert in the area of police interrogation tactics and influence of people involved in police interrogations.",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,Whether or not he's qualified as a expert is what we would like to address in voir dire.,,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,All right.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Q/A,"How many confessions has you analyzed, Doctor?",I've been requested to analyze a total of forty-eight separate interrogations leading to confessions.,,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Okay. Have you ever taken a coerced confession or a false confession from someone?,"Yes, I have.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Can you give us an example of that?,"In one particular case I was called in by the prosecution with the putting together the investigation of what was believed to be a multiple murder and sex abuse crime case. In the course of my work on that case -- again at the request of the prosecution -- I had access to an individual who was confessing to all manner of heinous crimes. In the course of my interviewing of him I began to become suspicious as to the validity of the confessions that he had been giving now for five months on a series of subjects. At that point after hearing from him what happened during the interrogation and certain other things about his reactions to the interrogation, I determined that there was a possibility that he had been falsely confessing and I determined to run an experiment. I then invented a crime on the spot and told him that one of his sons and one of his daughters had said that he had done something in particular to them, and asked him if he could remember it. Initially he said, ""No."" He then started using the techniques that he had been using to try to remember these events and I simply allowed him to do that -- in fact, sent him away and asked him to continue doing this alone and within twenty-four hours using the techniques that he had learned in the course of his five month long interrogations, he produced for me the next day a three page written detailed confession including dialogue that supposedly happened during the crime -- to a crime that never happened that I invented and daughter who was supposedly involved in it confirmed never happened. I then concluded that this was a highly suggestible individual because I had now succeeded with very minimal effort in eliciting a false confession from him.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Have you been ever -- excuse me -- have you been able to break down your work into percentages with regards to analyzing these confessions and the work you've done with confessions?,"Yes, I have. Of the forty-eight separate interrogations I have been asked to analyze, fifty-five percent of the time my conclusion has been that the statement that was made was voluntary or it was impossible for me to make a determination and forty-five percent of the time that the particular statement that was elicited was either what's called a coerced compliant confession or what's called a coerced internalized confession -- these are two different types of confessions generally two different types of false confessions.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Could you tell the jury the difference between these types of confessions?,"In the literature on interrogation and confession it was recognized that there are two kinds of involuntary and false confessions. One kind is called coerce compliant. This is a an-- inaccurate -- that is to say false statement -- that comes about because an individual no longer stand the strain of the interrogation and knowingly gives a statement that they know to be untrue. The other kind is much more complicated. It's called: a coerced internalized confession and this kind of statement arises when an individual actually becomes convinced that he or she has committed a crime that they had nothing to do with. The second kind of confession comes about out of the use of very special or very extraordinary influence techniques that operate in a particular way. It can occur by accident in the course of an ordinary police interrogation, but if it occurs certain things have to be present in the interrogation and they have to happen in a certain sequence in order to persuade someone that they've committed a crime of which they are innocent. The far more common kind of coerced statement is the coerced compliant statement when the individual simply gives up and agrees to say whatever they need to say because they can no longer stand the strain of what's going on.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,"Doctor, is it possible for police interrogation tactics to produce a false confession?","Yes. I don't know of any -- any researcher, any scholar in this area -- who works in this area who does not acknowledge that false confessions come about in the course of police interrogation, and in fact, a few years ago there was a landmark study of miscarriages of Justice in capital cases in American history. A study done by Professors Bideau (phonetic) of the University of Michigan and Ratalid (phonetic) of the University of Florida published in the Stanford Law Review. In this study they identified three hundred and fifty examples of miscarriages -- false convictions in capital cases in American history. And using the standards that they developed to judge whether or not a particular conviction was a miscarriage of justice -- in other words an improper conviction -- they identified three hundred and fifty examples in which by their criteria, which often had to do with the real killer being found, the person ultimately being pardoned -- standards of that sort -- they identified three hundred and fifty examples where the jury had found someone guilty who was in fact innocent. In that study nineteen percent of the miscarriages were caused by false confessions given by the suspects",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,"Doctor Ofshe, are certain individuals more susceptible to coercive police tactic than others?","Generally, it's been found that individuals who are lacking in self-confidence, low self-esteem are more persuadable and also more likely to respond to coercive tactics. Individuals who are mentally handicapped are also at risk to responding to coercive and overly persuasive tactics.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Can you tell the jury what it is that you do when you analyze a 'confession?,"Ah, that -- that starts with determining whether or not the interrogation has been tape recorded, if the interrogation has been tape recorded in its entirety, then the analysis of the influence process during the interrogation is time consuming and -- is time consuming, but is fairly straightforward. When police agencies have not tape recorded the interrogation, the problem becomes much more complicated because it becomes necessary to try to reconstruct the events of the interrogation from the available information. So that in a case such as this case in which part of the interrogation was recorded and most of it was not, it becomes necessary to first try to identify what actually happened in the interrogation and the order in which things happened to then relate that to the statements that are undisputed. That is to say that parts of the interrogation which are recorded so that one can hook up the analysis or hook up the history of the interrogation as it occurred in the unrecorded part but as reported on by the police officers involved as well as the suspect, in order to try to rebuild and get a picture of how the interrogation progressed from start to step-by-step-by-step, and the changes that occurred over the course of the interrogation. Now, in this particular case this culminates in the two recorded statements which give us a great deal of information about what happened during the interrogation and illustrate certain things about the tactics that were used and the suggestibility of the suspect in terms of how he responded to particular tactics that are -- that are simply captured in the recorded part of the interrogation. Then because it is -- has been reported on in the literature as to the kinds of ideas that develop people's minds in response to extremely pressured interrogations, I usually---",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Interruption,"Your Honor, at this time, if I may-- first enter an objection. He keeps referring to ""as reported in the literature"". Can he be more specific about what he's referring to? I don't know if these are books he's written or if it's something from other sources.",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Judge, that's exactly what I was trying to elicit from the witness before when he objected.",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,Your Honor--,,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,The scientific studies in this area that's what he was trying to testify about when the prosecutor objected.,,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Your Honor, the -- if I may explain. The reason I objected was because he was going into scientific literature which as I understood it the Court has ruled was beyond his area of expertise and that's exactly why I wanted him to -- to be more specific because he keeps referring to the literature and if I don't know what it is, I don't know whether that literature is valid literature. I don't know if it's something he has expertise in, or I don't know if it's a",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Okay, I think my ruling was that it invaded the province of the jury and that it was an ultimate question for the jury that exceeded the scope of his capabilities. That was my ruling. But that was to a narrow portion of it. I think what you're raising now -- if you're asking about the underlying data or information or scientific research that he -- he's utilizing, I think you're entitled to know that.",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,I'd be happy to:,,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,"However, I think you're entitled to bring that out on cross examination. So I'm going to let you develop it on cross examination. You might have him refer to any treatise or any scientific journal or -- that he's referring to and when he says ""literature"", and then you can develop it further.",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Judge, one other thing. He -- he indicated -- as I understood it -- that his analysis would be based on a reconstruction of the period prior to the taped confession, and it's my understanding that that reconstruction would require him to presume facts not in evidence and to base that upon speculation and upon statements -- out of court statements made by other individuals and we would strenuously object to him being able to give an opinion or to ""reconstruct"" something based on such speculative premises.",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Your Honor, there's nothing speculative about it. In fact the rule is very clear that he can base his opinion on such things. We discussed that earlier.",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,"I'm not sure I'm going to allow him to reconstruct, if that's what you're referring to. I'm going to allow him to testify based upon his learning, education, publications, and so forth an the field of social -- what was the field, Doctor?",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,Social psychology.,,THE WITNESS,P_WITNESS,
Interruption,"Social psychology, Okay, and I'm not real sure what that is, but I am real sure about what I told you I wasn't going to let in because that's for the jury to decide, and I'm not going to substitute this witness's opinion for theirs. All right, so let's proceed. You all know where we stand.",,THE COURT,COURT,
Q/A,"Let's back up to the scientific studies in this area, Doctor Ofshe, that you're familiar with regard to influence in police interrogation tactics. .... You mentioned the Stanford Law Review article. Are there any other treatises or studies you can refer to?",Yes. The book you held up before is perhaps the authoritative work in the area at this point by Professor Gudjonsson and he cites numerous studies by himself by hundreds of other people that all contributes to the analysis of police interrogation.,,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Are these theories and empirical studies commonly accepted by professionals in your field?,Yes.,,Defense,D_WITNESS
Interruption,Are they in universal acceptance?,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"The empirical studies are research based studies that people don't dispute the honesty of the researchers. They provide data. I think the data is accepted. The theories are not particularly esoteric, so that these are very data based studies. They have to do with studying the conditions, for example, under which individuals make the decision to confess when in fact they committed a crime. In other words, when interrogation is effective and when it elicits certain sorts of decisions, and they have to do with conditions that lead to statements that are coerced statements and in particularly---",,THE WITNESS,P_WITNESS,
Interruption,"Your Honor, I would like to object to this speech that he's making, It's not responsive to what the Court's question was which is whether this is universally accepted and he never said yes or no, he just---",,MR. FOGLEMAN,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Well, I think I understand what he's saying, but I guess you're right. He didn't---",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"I didn't -- I didn't get -- I didn't catch him saying that, yes, it was universally accepted. I think he's being evasive.",,MR. FOGLEMAN,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Well, that might have been a real general question, too. Can you answer yes or no and then continue with your explanation?",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Yes, your Honor, they' re universally accepted in the sense that they are data based and no one disputes the honesty of the researchers who report the data. The data is accepted. I then tried to go on to explain that the theories are not particularly esoteric arise from the data. So this is a very empirically grounded line of work.",,THE WITNESS,P_WITNESS,
Interruption,Is there contrary work?,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,Pardon?,,THE WITNESS,P_WITNESS,
Interruption,Are there contrary theories and contrary empirical data?,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"The -- the disputes would be about explaining why something happens rather than whether or not it happens. So that there might be different theories about the impact. For example, how much is attributable to personality or how much is attributable to something else. But there are hair-splitting disputes if everyone agrees to the basic -- that the basic phenomena exists.",,THE WITNESS,P_WITNESS,
Interruption,All right. Go ahead.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Q/A,"Doctor, I believe you stated earlier what you had to look at in this case with regard to Jessie Misskelley?","Yes, I did.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,You read the transcripts of his statement to the police -- both statements?,"Yes, I did.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,You've listened to the tapes?,Yes.,,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,You've also heard the officers testify at a previous hearing?,"Yes, I did.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Have you formed an opinion with regard to the specific issue of the voluntary nature of the defendant's statements to the police?,"Yes, I have.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
interruption,And what is that opinion?,,,Defense,
Interruption,Wait just a minute. Approach the bench.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,I'm not sure that's an appropriate question.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,I thought that's---,,MR. CROW,OTHERS,
Interruption,I thought that's what we--,,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,"No. I mean, are we going to start calling sociologists and psychologists to second guess a court?",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"How about, your Honor---",,MR. CROW,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Are we going -- are we going -- I mean, that -- I've already ruled it was voluntary. Now, am I going to let a witness get up here and contradict my ruling?",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Kagebein versus State, your Honor.",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,That's not what Kagebein holds---,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,Your Honor---,,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,And that is a jury issue granted.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Yes, sir.",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,"And the question is, obviously the Court's given an expert opinion regarding that and we can't bring that out to the Jury.",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,No.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,And it's based on the same thing. It's based on your review of those facts and evidence and we can't bring that out.,,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Your Honor, if I -- would the question be allowed, have you reached an opinion as to whether the statement was coerced.",,MR. CROW,OTHERS,
Interruption,That's the same---,,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,"That's one of the two things we were talking about awhile ago. I'm just trying to figure out what's going to work here, your Honor.",,MR. CROW,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Well, my notion of his testimony is that he can -- he can testify as to recognizable areas of--of -- of influence, of suggestion, but to give an opinion that would totally supplant the jury's function in making that decision, I'm not going to allow it.",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Judge, didn't we talk about this issue a minute ago when you said you would allow him to testify as to whether or not the statements were voluntary?",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,No. If I said that I didn't mean it because -- I don't think I did.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Your Honor, it would appear to me -- I just want to make sure I understand what the Court appears to be saying -- is that he can lay out what he bases his opinion on, but not give his opinion. I mean---",,MR. CROW,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Your Honor, we were clear on this.",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Well, I think that's what he can do. I think he can talk about the general principles that are applied, the general notion or concepts in that area in that field, but I-- I -- to allow him to testify that, in my opinion the confession was involuntary does two things. It -- one, it -- it goes to the issue that the jury will have to decide. Two, it directly refutes the ruling the Court's already made.",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Your Honor, an expert in a medical malpractice case testifies as to whether or not there was negligence on the part of the treating physician.",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,That's a little bit different.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Well, I don't see any difference at all, your Honor.",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,"It is very analogous to a child abuse situation where a doctor can testify, I found these factors and these factors, they sometimes exist when this happens, but they can't say, in my opinion sexual abuse occurred.",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,It's just like the Johnson case on the rape of that child. I'm going to allow him to testify right up to the point of where he's giving an opinion or inference that it was involuntary -- that it was coerced.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,Can he use that word coercive?,,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,It's the same thing.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Your Honor, the Jury is here to decide the voluntariness---",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,"That's exactly right and he's not, and that's my ruling. . .",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,This expert is here to offer an opinion with regard to that issue. It will assist the trier of fact in determining that issue. It's for the jury.,,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,I'm not going to allow him to testify on that opinion. You can make an offer of proof if you want.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Your Honor, please -- please tell me what it was that I could ask him a few minutes ago that I don't understand I can ask him now.",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,I just told you.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,I can ask him what?,,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,"You can ask him to talk about the facts and circumstances, the conditions that he observed and that he saw these factors for what the police did, that they -- that they're suggestive techniques. Those are the kinds of things I'm going to allow him to testify to. But I'm not going to allow him to give that ultimate opinion, an I know what the rules say, and I'm saying that our Court will adopt the modification that the federal court made, and that you're trying to get this witness to supplant the Jury and to become the jury on that issue. I'm not going to allow it.",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Judge, another thing for the record his opinion on that is based in large part on what the defendant told him.",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,I understand that. That's another basis for it.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Your Honor, will you note our objection and allow us to--",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,Sure.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,---make an offer of proof?,,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,Yes. You're making a record now.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"In that case if this is our offer, it needs to be shown on the record that his opinion would be that it was -- however the question was worded either involuntary confession or coerced confession -- that is how he would testify.",,MR. CROW,OTHERS,
Interruption,I want to make sure I'm crystal clear. I want to follow the Court's order to a tee. Can I ask this witness whether or not any of the tactics employed by the police in this interrogation were coercive or psychologically overbearing?,,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,Based on what he heard in their testimony.,,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Yes, I'll let you ask those questions. .... But the difference is you're asking him whether or not this was involuntary and allow him to say, In my opinion it was involuntary well, what does involuntary mean? Does that mean the State --or the officers did something impermissible, illegal -- there are a number of things in the psychological area and the sociological area that the police could do that are perfectly permissible. Psychological techniques are not necessarily improper or wrong. From a psychologist' s standpoint, he might say, Well, by using these subtle techniques they caused him to -- to confess. That doesn't mean that they're involuntary. It means that they're good techniques. So it means a lot of different things, and I'm not---",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,Am I allowed to ask the question---,,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Your Honor, for the record, what this person is saying from a standpoint of a psychologist it might be involuntary in the sense that the person didn't want to say it, but it doesn't mean in a legal sense that it's involuntary, and for that reason we would also---",,MR. FOGLEMAN,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Well, that's what I was trying to enunciate just a minute ago.",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,I told you I would let you ask that last question.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Judge, that is premised on what he's read in their transcript of that -- read or heard him testify to.",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Yes, that's correct.",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,That's what I just asked him Judge.,,MR. STIDHAM:,OTHERS,
Interruption,All right. I'll allow that.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Q/A,"Doctor Ofshe, I need to rephrase the question for you. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not some of the interrogation tactics employed by the police against Mr. Misskelley were coercive in nature or overborne his will?","Yes, I do.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
interruption,Could you tell the jury what that opinion is?,,,Defense,
Interruption,"Your Honor, I -- wait -- wait -- wait. We -- I hate to object and I apologize for this, but the Court just told Mr. Stidham---",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,That I could ask that question.,,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,Well---,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,He knows---,,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,

Interruption,Okay. Let's -- let's do this in some order. Go ahead if you want to make a proffer of proof and let's be sure that I know what I'm excluding and what -- that I know what you're attempting to put in and then maybe it'll change my opinion. I don't know.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Q/A,"Doctor, have you formed any opinions with regard to this case?","Yes, I have.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Could you tell the Court your opinion?,"That the statement made by Jessie Misskelley was a product of the influence tactics brought to bear on him, and that it overbore his initial stated intention to maintain that he had nothing to do with this crime and was not there, and that it was a process of influence brought to bear represented by the interrogation tactics that progressively changed his statements about that subject.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Okay. Were there any other tactics in particular that -- that you thought were important?,"The interrogation forms a process in which one step builds on the preceding step. And so, for example, the interrogation changes dramatically prior to and then after the polygraph -- I assume it's all right at this point for me to discuss the polygraph.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Interruption,"Yes, since we're outside the presence of the Jury.",,THE COURT,COURT,
Q/A,"First of all, Doctor, are you familiar with Mr. Holmes' report on the polygraph?","Yes, I am.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Okay.,"The polygraph as used in this interrogation has two effects. One based on the opinion formed by the polygrapher -- which as I'm aware Mr. Holmes says was an inappropriate opinion -- that Mr. Misskelley was ""lying his ass off."" That that created the circumstances under which the interrogators could shift to a -- an accusatory interrogation, one in which maximum pressure is brought to bear on the suspect and they then did precisely that. The second effect of the polygraph is that Mr. Misskelley was told that there existed this machine -- scientific machine that was recording that he had done something that he knew he had not done. While Mr. Misskelley reported to me that he did not believe the polygraph the fact that -- the fact that he was told that contributed to his sense of helplessness that he had which developed over the course of the interrogation. In conjunction with the other tactics and the other procedures of the interrogation the polygraph played an important role in swaying the influence process that was the entire interrogation and culminated with the two recorded statements.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,"What effect did the diagram -- the circle diagram, the photographs of the body and the playing of the tapes have in your analysis?","Those particular techniques as testified to by the police officers and as I would understand them to fit in police interrogations so far as I -- I understand police interrogations and have studied them -- the technique of using the circle is an important technique because in this particular interrogation and consistent with what the officers say, that the technique was not being used to try to suggest that Jessie Misskelley that he was a suspect who was believed to be culpable but rather than he possessed information that was vital to the case and that the offer that was communicated through that was an offer to join the police. Mr. Misskelley in my interview with him when I asked him about the impact of the circle technique, did not fully comprehend what would follow if you could not get out of circle. He simply did not understand what the consequences would be. The extent to which he could understand that was characterized by him in the interview I did. He knew that it was bad. He knew that it was a place where he did not want to be. And he knew that if he simply conformed -- and that is to say to agree with the police -- that they would take him out from the center of the circle and they could join him. Over the course of the interrogation as the interrogation became accusatory and the offer for safe harbor was made using the circle technique as what then happened after the circle technique was used and based on my analysis of the sequence of the interrogation, based on the notes -- the contemporaneous notes of the interrogation by Detective Ridge together with the testimony of the police officers -- it's my opinion that that circle technique probably occurred early in the interrogation. It was then followed by an hour and a half of intense pressure brought to bear on Mr. Misskelley in which he was told repeatedly when he said -- first he would often say that he wanted to go home and he was told he could not go home, that's what Mr. Misskelley reports, which for my purposes contributed to the sense of helplessness that there was no way to escape these pressures. Over the course of this hour and a half we have Detective Ridge's notes which. indicate that Mr. Misskelley was now beginning to talk about the existence of a satanic cult, was giving the detective the kinds of statements that would implicate Damien and Jason which it is my opinion that the purpose of the entire interrogation and particularly the use of the circle technique. The contemporaneously notes illustrate the statement that Mr. Misskelley was successively giving that were statements that were damning to Damien and Jason. This according to Mr. Misskelley was coupled with repeatedly being asked questions about the facts of the crime and every time he would guess something and it would be an incorrect guess even what was known about the facts of the crime, Detective Ridge would be sitting there shaking his head no indicating that this was the wrong answer. This was repeated on several subjects and Mr. Misskelley was continually pressured in this way. Mr. Misskelley describes that what he learned to do was to feed back to the interrogators what they were telling him happened and he sought to avoid making mistakes because when he made mistakes they would make him go back through the entire story and they would not believe him when he repeatedly told them that he was working with Rickey Deese that day and he knew nothing about the crime. Those repeated refusals to believe his statements about where he was contributed again to his sense of helplessness. Then the picture technique and the tape recording was used. According to the testimony of Detective Gitchell and Detective Ridge the purpose of using -- at least Detective Gitchell on this point -- the purpose of using the picture was to get a response from Mr. Misskelley. The object in the course of an interrogation would have been -- and this is still at this point -- for someone whose principal interest to the interrogators to obtain statements against another, the -- the technique is showing a group of photographs of a murdered boy was designed to put additional pressure on Mr. Misskelley and it succeeded and there are descriptions in the testimony of Detective Gitchell and Detective Ridge and the description that I obtained from Mr. Misskelley about his reactions to the use of the picture. All of those descriptions include Mr. Misskelley's becoming transfixed, terribly upset by the picture, staring at it, not responding to other questions, Mr. Misskelley adds that it was a horrible picture and he began to cry. He became increasingly upset in immediate response to the use of the picture. That was followed by the audio tape of a little boy's voice saying the words that the little boy said. Subsequent to that, Mr. Misskelley stated that -- in effect he stated -- and the very words are quoted by Detective Gitchell and similar words are used by Detective Ridge -- ""I want out."" I have the exact quote and what I just quoted is not exact either, but the statement that was made, was the statement 'I want out."" A reference to the offer contained in the circle that, I'll do what you want in order to escape this continuing relentless pressure of the interrogation. Subsequent to that and immediately following that according to Detective Gitchell he got the tape recorder and would get the first recorded statement. The person -- it's possible now to analyze the influence process contained in the first recorded statement. We now have the first undisputed record in the case and in that part of the interrogation it's possible to demonstrate how relentless, the leading, suggestions, and an unwillingness to accept anything other than what the police knew the facts of the crime to be. This was continually suggested to Mr. Misskelley and we can chart his moving step-by-step-by-step from an inaccurate statement to a statement that was put in his mouth by the police and the tape recorded part of it illustrates that. And I'm prepared to go through that step-by-step to illustrate how that happened. Even then there were still gross inaccuracies in the statement. The next thing that happened is that Mr. Misskelley is left alone and Detective Gitchell meets with Prosecutor Fogleman and some of the specific gross inaccuracies in the -- the recorded statement are now discussed and according to Detective Gitchell's statement, Prosecutor Fogleman sends him back in to work on these particular statements. And then we can look at the second statement and show how precisely that happened and how again Jessie Misskelley is conforming to the demand placed on him and is changing his statement from direct response to suggestions and direct instructions by Detective Gitchell. There are illustrations of interrogation tactics in the second part of the statement that illustrate what I'm talking about and also illustrates Mr. Misskelley's strategies of simply parroting back to the police what they told him in order not to displease them and not to be subject to additional questions. That's the outline of my testimony and analysis of the process of influence in this interrogation.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,And you are prepared to go through step-by-step and cite page numbers of the statement to demonstrate this?,"Page numbers of every statement, on every point, statements made by the police officers, statements made by Mr. Misskelley. These are the facts that I deal with.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Have you also formed an opinion as to the classification of his confession?,"I would classify this confession as a coerced compliant confession and for a number of other reasons having to do with other specific statements in the confession statement and gross inaccuracies in the scenario that Mr. Misskelley produces, I would reach the opinion that this interrogation was far more -- these statements are far more likely product of influence than they are based on any memory that Mr. Misskelley has of the crime.",,Defense,D_WITNESS

Interruption,"Yes, your Honor, I---",,MR. STIDHAM,OTHERS,
Interruption,Go ahead.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Q/A,"Are there any other opinions you have, Doctor, with regard to the interrogation itself?",I don't believe so. I have a lot of specific illustrations that I've been talking about.,,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,I understand that you also have some experience and training with regard to cult---,"Yes, I do.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,---and you won a Pulitzer Prize with regard to working in cults?,"Yes, I did. I shared one, yes.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,And is it true that you have worked internationally with regards to satanic cult homicides or -- or let me rephrase that -- to allegations of satanic ritualistic abuse or homicides?,"I've consulted internationally, if Canada counts, ah, specifically on an occult inspired murder which was a real occult inspired murder. I've consulted on other cases in which there had been allegations of the existence of a baby murdering satanic cult of the sort that is based on all the available evidence, based on the studies done by the F. B. I., appear to be totally without foundation insofar as there have now been over three hundred separate investigations of allegations of child murdering, child sexual abusing, secret satanic cults. None of these allegations have resulted in any evidence that suggests that these groups exist. This is a conclusion by Kenneth Lanning of the F. B. I. On the other hand, there are in my experience what I would call youth culture groups that get interested in the occult and these are the groups that are responsible for graffiti, responsible for the undisputed animal mutilations that sometimes occur. The dividing line is between the murderous baby killing satanic cults and the youth culture groups and the occasional occult inspired criminal groups that in fact do exist. So there's both a reality to it and then there's a mythical level to it.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Have you -- do you have an opinion of whether or not the homicides in question Mr. Misskelley is charged with or have anything to do with satanic rituals or anything of the occult?,"As far as I am able to tell from what I know of the evidence, there is no evidence that suggests that there is an occult element to this and as far as the satanic panic tips that are given to the police, my understanding is that none of them have panned out. None of them has produced corroboration and that they have been investigated and this is what one would expect if this is an example of a satanic hysteria that it's picked up by the police. This sort of thing happens, when it happens, when there is a particularly heinous crime for which there is no obvious explanation. This is when these sorts of allegations are likely to surface.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,What are you basing your opinion on in this case -- that opinion with regards to this not being a cult killing?,"What I know about the follow-up, the lead that suggested that there existed some cult, that Jessie Misskelley or anyone else was a member of. For example, during his interrogation, Mr. Misskelley provided a list of people who were supposedly members of the cult, and according to the testimony of Detective Ridge who followed that up was knowledgeable at the time of the deaths, none of those people confirmed the existence of a cult. Apparently there is one individual who claims to have attended a cult meeting. Apparently her testimony also -- or her report is equally unconfirmed. As far as I can tell there is an absence of hard information suggesting that such a satanic cult exists in this area and in addition, I know of nothing about the crime scene that suggests that this is an occult ritual killing.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
interruption,"Thank you, Doctor.",,,Defense,
Interruption,Do you want to add anything?,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Judge, my concern at this point and I got lost in that monologue there---",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,Don't feel too bad.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"---Okay. I got lost back there about the time he got to the first taped confession, but at least prior to that time what I heard was Mr. Ofshe talking about what Jessie told him in a statement. And, Judge, there are two things about that. Number one, what he has done is taken these-- a statement that we've never seen, we weren't privy to, and he is now going to paraphrase that statement -- or so-called statement -- to the jury coming from a so-called expert in some official capacity to be the basis for why he finds police coercion. Now, number one, we -- we objected to him coming in as an expert in the first place, but assuming he is an expert, if he can limit his -- his testimony to what he heard the officers say in their testimony, of what he read in a transcript about what the officers said, but when he starts saying, ""Jessie told me at this point the officer really bore down on him and they spent another hour and a half with him. This made him increase his feelings of helplessness."" Now, your Honor, we can't cross examine Jessie if his voice is coming through the body of Doctor Ofshe, and that's what they're basically trying to do and that's clearly inappropriate. He -- there is no possible way that a person in his position can rely on a statement he took from a person and then paraphrase it and translate it to a jury. That's hearsay. It doesn't matter whether it comes from him or whether it comes from someone else. That's hearsay testimony. He can say what he observed. He can testify how that affects his opinion. He can list the facts that indicate coercion. If he goes beyond that, your Honor, the State feels that he's clearly gotten into a province that's -- that's the sole province of the jury -- in the area that's the sole province of the jury.",,MR. DAVIS,OTHERS,
Interruption,"All right, I've heard the proffer of proof and it can be submitted as a proffer of proof, and it would be my finding that the information elicited and the testimony proffered not only embraces the ultimate issue or facts for the jury to consider, that it in effect tells the jury what their finding should be. And I'm -- I'm going to apply the rule in Gramling versus Jennings, 274 Ark. 346. I'm going to apply the additional phrasing adopted by Congress in nineteen eighty-four to Rule Eight Oh Four that says explicitly, ""No expert witness testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant in a criminal case may state an opinion or inference as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged or a defense thereof."" And I think that applies here and I think the term -- just reading Rule 704 alone, it says, ""Testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of the fact."" The question is: What does embrace mean and our court tried to define it in two or three cases. One of them was that Gramling case. Another one is Aetna Casualty -- that was a civil case. I just think under the facts and circumstance of this case, to allow him to testify in the fashion tendered would be eliminating the jury and accepting an expert's opinion. So the opinion of the jury is what's significant to me. There are some things that he testified to such as the occult activity that he might properly testify to. There are other things that I would allow him to testify to that would be in the general nature of his expert knowledge, but to give that final and conclusive opinion in -- in the fashion that it's elicited -- says, Jury, you must find this way - and I'm not going to allow it.",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"I -- I -- everything -- everything you've just said, however, I submit would be an appropriate argument that you may make to the jury at the proper time, and that an expert in his capacity normally is employed to consult with and discuss trial strategies and techniques with counsel.

Interruption,Sure.,,THE COURT,COURT,
Q/A,Could you give some examples of the police being coercive and leading or suggestive during the course of the interrogation?,"Yes, I can. Perhaps the most powerful example in my opinion is the example of the eight revisitings of the question of the time at which the crimes occurred. The first example occurs on page -- in my numbering -eleven -- which I believe is page three -- and this is the point at which Detective Ridges says, ""All right, when did you go with them?"" Mr. Misskelley says, 'That morning."" Detective Ridge says, 'Nine o'clock in the morning?"" Jessie says, ""Yes, I did. I went with them and then""-- Then they talk about walking. At that point Jessie is now saying he went there at nine o'clock in the morning. I believe that there is a mistyping here. I believe it's Jessie said, ""Nine o'clock in the morning."" But this transcript does not say that and I'll point that out. That's my recollection. In any case he agrees or says that it was nine o'clock in the morning. There is no follow-up at that point. The tape recorder is on. Nine o'clock in the morning is grossly inaccurate as everyone knows. Detective Ridge has testified in hearings that that was the first time that any time for this occurring happened and in his hearing testimony at page ninety-nine of the transcript. The next time the subject of the time at which the events occurred comes up is on page nine of the first transcribed interrogation and, at this point without reading it, I'll just point out that Detective Ridge asked Mr. Misskelley -- he's now revisiting the subject. He asks Mr. Misskelley, ""I'm not saying when they called you. I'm saying what time was it that you were actually there in the park?"" Mr. Misskelley says, ""About noon."" Ridge says, ""About noon? -- and it has a question mark. Jessie says, ""Yes."" Ridge now says something that in my opinion was an attempt to manipulate Mr. Misskelley's statement about the time because Detective Ridge now says, ""Okay, was it after school had let out?"" This is immediately after Jessie saying, ""It's at noon."" He's now suggesting it must be later by saying, ""Is it after school let out?"" Jessie says, ""I didn't go to school."" Ridge now has to clarify and say, ""These little boys."" Jessie says, ""They skipped school."" Ridge says, ""They skipped school?"" -- with a question mark. Then there was more discussion about their bikes and so on. Again, there is an error. We know it's impossible for these boys to have been there at noon. Going on to the third example on page nineteen. Now, it's Detective Gitchell who revisits the question of time still because the time is inaccurate and he raises -- ""Now, did you say the boys skipped school that day? These little boys did?"" Said in that way, it's a suggestion that you change your answer indicating, I'm displeased with this. This isn't the right answer. Did you really say would be the emphasis on that. Jessie then answers. He asks -- Gitchell now asks, ""What time did you get there?"" Jessie again repeats, ""I got there about nine."" Gitchell says, ""In the morning?"" Jessie says, ""Yes."" So Jessie now attempts again to say he got there at nine in the morning. Now, I am of the belief that there has been testimony that Jessie was roofing that morning. I believe that that was testified to. So that would be an example if I'm correct in that belief that Jessie was somewhere -- says he was somewhere else and someone confirms that and he is now saying he got there at nine o'clock in the morning. Clearly a contradiction.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,"Doctor Ofshe, is there another example in the second recorded statement?",Yes. This goes on and is repeated several times. If I can just illustrate one other point in the first statement.,,Defense,D_WITNESS
Q/A,Certainly.,"There is a very important example of the way in which the detectives refuse to allow Jessie's inaccurate statement to stand and directly manipulated Jessie's statement through skillful interrogation tactics. So for example, on page eighteen of the transcript at the conclusion of a discussion about the supposed cult, Detective Ridge now changes the subject. There is nothing that precedes this about the timing, but now for the fourth time revisits the timing and this time Detective Ridge says and I quote ""Okay. The night you were in the woods, had you all been in the water?"" Jessie replies, ""Yeah, we'd been in the water. We were in it that night playing around in it. This is the first time in the record according to my analysis of it and according to Detective Ridge's testimony that it is directly suggested to Jessie that the correct answer is, ""This happened at night."" Immediately upon that being suggested Jessie is -- responds by accepting and now he starts to use the word ""at night"", where he had never used it before, where he had consistently said it was during the day. It is in direct response to Detective Ridge's substitution and introduction into the interrogation the correct fact that this happened at night so Jessie now adopts that. That is an influence tactic. It is a way of getting someone to accept something out of pressure and out of suggestion. Detective Ridge follows up with his victory on page thirty -- page twenty-four of the transcript at the bottom where Detective Ridge now capitalizing in my opinion on his victory at getting night into the story now seeks to do what I was describing before -- stabilize that -- by saying the following -- and again, this is introduced by Ridge and there is nothing preceding it from which this follows. He is choosing to return to this subject and he says, Okay they killed the boys. You decided to go. You went home. How long after you got home before you received the phone, call-- thirty minutes or an hour?"" Now there has been previous testimony about a phone call to Jessie at home at nine P.M. That's what Detective Ridge is referring to. But Detective Ridge now links this up with Jessie going home and gives Jessie the choice of having arrived home either thirty minutes or an hour before the phone call occurred, which would mean he's now suggesting to Jessie and elaborating on the story and getting Jessie to--as he next does -- Jessie says, ""Uh"" -- there's a silence and then he says, ""An hour."" So Ridge had given Jessie a choice. You can either say you got home a half hour before the phone call or you can say you got home an hour before the phone call. Those are the only choices he's got. Jessie now chooses an hour. Again, that's a tactic of influence. That is posing the question in such a way that you only have two choices. Either one of those choices, I win. Detective Ridge is using that technique. Then we get to the second interrogation. That's the last time that the time subject comes up in the first interrogation. As we know at two forty-four in the afternoon -- at three-eighteen in the afternoon the first tape was finished. According to Detective Gitchell no one spoke with Jessie between then and the time that Detective Gitchell-- after meeting with the Prosecutor Fogleman-- went back in to get the statement that is labeled ""Interview of Jessie Misskelley, Junior, Second Interview Conducted to Clarify Previous Statement."" The last two times you will recall that Jessie said that anything was brought up about time, Jessie had been successfully moved to talk about the events happening in the evening instead of in the morning which is where he started. So now Gitchell comes in and on page one of the second transcript begins with, ""Jessie, uh -- when you got with the boys and with Jason Baldwin when you three were in the woods and them little boys come up, about what time was it when the boys come up to the woods?"" Jessie replied, ""I would say it was about five or so five or six."" So Jessie is now moving in the direction of later but it's as if there is the original statement that he made about the morning and he's being slowly moved towards the evening but clearly in this statement he has not gone far enough because five or six I gather from what I've been informed about the testimony is too early for the boys to have shown up at the woods. Now, we have---",,Defense,D_WITNESS
Interruption,"Your Honor, I'm going to have to object to that Statement by this witness. There is no basis for him concluding that five or six is too early for this defendant and the defendants to show up in the woods. There is no basis for that.",,MR. FOGLEMAN,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Well, he's been talking for ten minutes. I guess that's been in response to a question. I don't know. What is your objection?",,THE COURT,COURT,
Interruption,"Your Honor, my objection is that he is testifying on things that are not in the record and have not been testified to.",,MR. FOGLEMAN,OTHERS,
Interruption,"Absolutely, your Honor, and specifically on this point the transcript says when the little boys come up. It is a specific statement about when the children arrived.",,THE WITNESS,P_WITNESS,
Q/A,"Your last example, Doctor?","The next after failing to get the time moved to the proper time, Detective Gitchell uses another interrogation tactic. He now says -- and I quote from page one of the second transcript -- ""All right, you told me earlier around seven or eight. Which time is it?"" And there are two important things about this. The first one is it's obvious that Detective Gitchell is doing the same thing that Detective Ridge has done earlier -- giving Jessie a choice. Pick one and I win or pick two and I win -- either seven or eight. Gitchell can live with either answer and he's giving Jessie only those two choices. But what's even more important about this is that nowhere in the record, including the record of what the detectives say, the notes, the specific statements by Detective Ridge, the transcript of the first interrogation, is there any indication that Jessie ever said -- as Detective Gitchell says, ""You told me earlier around seven or eight."" There is an absolute absence of anything indicating that. That's extremely important to me because what this illustrates is the legitimate interrogation tactic of making up evidence, of overstating, inaccurately stating the evidence. This is something that happens in police interrogations all the time. It is not something that it is my understanding is improper in police interrogations. It is something I see all the time and it is a tactic for manipulating the suspect and, in this case, based on my review of the evidence there is no place at which Jessie told Ridge ---told Gitchell that they had arrived there at seven or eight, And in fact Detective Ridge in his testimony in the hearing makes very clear that the very first time any time came up was when Jessie said, ""Nine o'clock in the morning."" And we have a complete record of every utterance from that point forward. So Detective Ridge who was present with Detective Gitchell says prior to the beginning of the tape no time was mentioned and we note every mention of time prior to that. So it's my opinion that this is a tactic and it's a very effective tactic because Jessie now simply repeats back to Detective Gitchell what Gitchell told him. He says, ""It was seven or eight."" Jessie doesn't even make a choice. He just tells Gitchell everything that Gitchell told him. That's an indication of someone who is willing to comply and does not want to take any chances of making a mistake and therefore being punished for it through pressure. Then there's some more discussion of that and -- and it changes again. But that's one example. There are many other examples of -- of illustrations of manipulation on important points throughout this record.",,Defense,D_WITNESS
