                 You are a juror in a cross-examination. Your role is to evaluate witness responses and determine which side is more convincing based on the conversation.
                 A strategic witness does not assume a common goal. The following Gricean Maxims can be reliably violated to retrieve interests or minimize losses from making a commitment:
                Truthfulness (Quality): avoid falsehoods and speaks only what they believe to be true.
                Relevance: addresse the specific question being asked.
                Clarity (Manner): avoid vagueness, ambiguity, or unnecessary complexity.
                Accordingly, judgments about the witness’s commitment should be based on whether the response advances the witness’s interests (i.e., winning potential)
                 Below is the transcript of the cross-examination so far:
                {history}

                The current response from the witness is: {answer}

                Instructions:
                Please evaluate the current response based on following properties:
                1. Witness commitment level (with respect to the immediate question):
                   - 1: Detrimental commitment (contributing to questioner's winning not the witness's)
                   - 2: Beneficial commitment (contributing to witness's winning not the questioner's)
                   - 3: Neutral commitment
                   - 4: No commitment made
                   
                2. Witness truthfulness in current turn:
                   - 1: Truthful
                   - 0: Not truthful
                   
                3. Consistency with previous testimony:
                   - 1: Inconsistent
                   - 0: Consistent
                   
                4. Response relevance:
                   - 1: Very relevant
                   - 2: Slightly relevant
                   - 3: Slightly irrelevant 
                   - 4: Irrelevant 
                
                5. Response clarity:
                   - 1: Very clear
                   - 2: Slightly clear with hedging
                   - 3: Slightly unclear
                   - 4: Unclear
                   
                6. Current turn outcome:
                   - Questioner
                   - Witness
                
                7. Reasons for current outcome:
                    - 1. Logical arguments are convincing
                    - 2. Credibility attack on other side
                    - 3. Emotional appeal/bias

                Here are some examples:
                Example 1:
                Question: Are you taking any medication?
                response: I might have taken some.
                This response is a detrimental commitment as taking medication indicates mental instability. 
                This response is relevant (1) but not clear with hedging (3), and truthful (1).
                The winner is Questioner and the reason is logical arguments.

                Example 2:
                Question: Have you been to the place where the body was found?
                Response: I think I have no reason to go to place like that.
                This response is a beneficial commitment as not have gone to the crime spot indicates alibi. 
                This response is relevant (1), unclear with hedging (3), and truthful (1).
                The winner is Witness and the reason is logical arguments.

                Example 3:
                Question: You have interviewed with the defendant for ten hours?
                Response: No
                This response is a detrimental commitment as having decent amount contact with defendant indicates the witness has enough knowledge about defendant so denying would indicate the opposite.
                This response is relevant (1), clear (1), and truthful (1).
                The winner is Questioner and the reason is logical arguments.
