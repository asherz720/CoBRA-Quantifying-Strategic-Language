D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?

Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.",D_WITNESS,"PROSECUTION: Okay. Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that that kind of an assault with the brick on the head by beating numerous times produces enormous amount of blood and it did so in the Hoeplinger case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that on the suspect's jeans, there were only two drops of blood?
D_WITNESS: Well, we assume that's the original jean. I don't have any record, but I do know he wash his T-shirt. I found a T-shirt washed in the pond.

PROSECUTION: Right.

Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that that kind of an assault with the brick on the head by beating numerous times produces enormous amount of blood and it did so in the Hoeplinger case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that on the suspect's jeans, there were only two drops of blood?
D_WITNESS: Well, we assume that's the original jean. I don't have any record, but I do know he wash his T-shirt. I found a T-shirt washed in the pond.

PROSECUTION: Right.
D_WITNESS: But the blue jean, whether or not that's the original blue jean, I have no or information, record of it.

PROSECUTION: Well, you testified in court and those blue jeans were presented to a jury as being worn by the suspects--suspect, the husband at the time of the murder; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I--that's long time ago. If you say correct, probably correct. I don't recall. There's thousands cases I been working on.

PROSECUTION: Does that seem to be consistent with your memory?
D_WITNESS: Sure. Sure.

PROSECUTION: And only two blood drops?

36,Yes.,simpson_defense_6,"And the scene was covered in blood, correct?",D_WITNESS,"PROSECUTION: Okay. Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that that kind of an assault with the brick on the head by beating numerous times produces enormous amount of blood and it did so in the Hoeplinger case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that on the suspect's jeans, there were only two drops of blood?
D_WITNESS: Well, we assume that's the original jean. I don't have any record, but I do know he wash his T-shirt. I found a T-shirt washed in the pond.

PROSECUTION: Right.
D_WITNESS: But the blue jean, whether or not that's the original blue jean, I have no or information, record of it.

PROSECUTION: Well, you testified in court and those blue jeans were presented to a jury as being worn by the suspects--suspect, the husband at the time of the murder; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I--that's long time ago. If you say correct, probably correct. I don't recall. There's thousands cases I been working on.

PROSECUTION: Does that seem to be consistent with your memory?
D_WITNESS: Sure. Sure.

PROSECUTION: And only two blood drops?
D_WITNESS: I don't remember. If you say two drops, it's two drop.

PROSECUTION: And the scene was covered in blood, correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Sir, if a person were to wrap their hand around someone's throat and slit that person's throat--
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: --and the blood spurted forward, would you expect the assailant to be covered in blood?
