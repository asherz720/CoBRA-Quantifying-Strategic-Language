COURT: All right. Mr. Darden, where are you going with this?

PROSECUTION: I'm trying to establish what the date is, because--I will give this to Mr. Cochran. This is the printout on the F.I.'s with that time with Mr. Hodge. There were many, many, many, many contacts by LAPD, from the narcotics and gang units, of Mr. Hodge. Mr. Hodge was a crack dealer over on Corning Avenue, an area where crack was sold by him and members of the Playboy Gangster Crips.

PROSECUTION: Judge, isn't the issue whether or not Fuhrman arrested this man and indicated to him--the issue he was called for you limited very specifically was whether Fuhrman turned around and said, ""I tell you I will get you Nigger."" That is the question. It happened in January of 1987. That is the question.

D_WITNESS: Yes, sir, it does. It appears to be.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Okay. And on the last page of that document does it indicate that you had a second interview with someone from Internal Affairs on January 23, 1987, an interview with a Sergeant Lamprey?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir, it does indicate that.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Did you have such an interview?

D_WITNESS: I haven't read over the entire of the interview, sir.

PROSECUTION: Did you see the epithet indicated here in these documents?
