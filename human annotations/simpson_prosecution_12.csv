DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
P_WITNESS: I WOULDN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY.

DEFENSE: WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF CRIME SCENE CONTAMINATION TO FIRST PROTECT THESCENE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?

WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?

P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
P_WITNESS: I WOULDN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY.

DEFENSE: YES. BUT SHE DID THE MOST.
P_WITNESS: SHE DID MOST OF IT, YES.

DEFENSE: WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF CRIME SCENE CONTAMINATION TO FIRST PROTECT THESCENE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?
P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?

P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR.

P_WITNESS: THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1995 9:20 A.M.

P_WITNESS: THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE, NO.

DEFENSE: WHICH ONE DID YOU SWATCH?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL EXACTLY WHICH ONES I ASSISTED HER WITH, BUT THERE WERE PORTIONS OF STAINS WHERE IACTUALLY TOOK THE TWEEZERS AND DID THE MANIPULATION MYSELF.

WHAT I DID WAS WET THE CLOTH SWATCHES WITH DISTILLED WATER AND THEN APPLIED THEM TO THE STAIN, THE RED STAINS WHICH WERE LATER DETERMINED TO BE BLOOD, AND THEY WERE TRANSFERRED ON -- IN THAT METHOD."" WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
P_WITNESS: I WOULDN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY.

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

P_WITNESS: THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1995 9:20 A.M.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?

P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR.

P_WITNESS: THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1995 9:20 A.M.

P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
P_WITNESS: WHAT ABOUT IT?

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?

WHAT I DID WAS WET THE CLOTH SWATCHES WITH DISTILLED WATER AND THEN APPLIED THEM TO THE STAIN, THE RED STAINS WHICH WERE LATER DETERMINED TO BE BLOOD, AND THEY WERE TRANSFERRED ON -- IN THAT METHOD."" WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
P_WITNESS: I WOULDN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?
P_WITNESS: THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1995 9:20 A.M.

P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: WELL, YOU HAD TOLD THIS JURY YESTERDAY THAT YOU CARRIED THE BLOOD VIAL--BLOOD SAMPLE EITHER IN A BROWN PAPER BAG IN THE POSSE BOX OR IN YOUR HANDS, CORRECT?

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
P_WITNESS: WHAT ABOUT IT?

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
P_WITNESS: WHAT ABOUT IT?

DEFENSE: IF THERE WERE SOMETHING FILLED IN THERE THAT SAID 5:15 AS TO THE TIME LEAVING SCENE, THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE GRAY ENVELOPE YOU RECEIVED FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?

P_WITNESS: THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE, NO.

DEFENSE: WHICH ONE DID YOU SWATCH?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL EXACTLY WHICH ONES I ASSISTED HER WITH, BUT THERE WERE PORTIONS OF STAINS WHERE IACTUALLY TOOK THE TWEEZERS AND DID THE MANIPULATION MYSELF.

WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
P_WITNESS: I WOULDN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY.

DEFENSE: YES. BUT SHE DID THE MOST.
P_WITNESS: SHE DID MOST OF IT, YES.

DEFENSE: WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF CRIME SCENE CONTAMINATION TO FIRST PROTECT THESCENE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?
P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: SO IT'S YOUR TESTIMONY OR IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY THAT ON JULY 6TH, YOU WENT AT THE REQUEST OF MISS CLARK AND YOU LOOKED FOR BLOODSTAINS ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE BRONCO DOOR?

DEFENSE: ISN'T IT TRUE, MR. FUNG, THAT YOU NEVER REMOVED ANYTHING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THAT BRONCO DOOR ON JULY 6TH FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING A PRESUMPTIVE TEST?
P_WITNESS: I DID PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON A DARK STAIN AT THE DOOR SILL OF THE DRIVER DOOR.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?
P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?

P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR.

P_WITNESS: THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1995 9:20 A.M.

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
P_WITNESS: WHAT ABOUT IT?

DEFENSE: IF THERE WERE SOMETHING FILLED IN THERE THAT SAID 5:15 AS TO THE TIME LEAVING SCENE, THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE GRAY ENVELOPE YOU RECEIVED FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?
P_WITNESS: IF THERE WAS THAT TIME THERE, YES, IT WOULD.

DEFENSE: AND THAT IS WHY YOU DESTROYED THE ORIGINAL PAGE 4, MR. FUNG?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU EACH OF THE ORIGINALS OF THIS CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST. I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THEM AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THE UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF EACH OF THE PAGES AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE--LET ME PUT IT IN ORDER FOR YOU.

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU GAVE US TESTIMONY THAT THE FIBERS FROM A CARPET CAN GET INTO THE CREVICES OF SHOES?
P_WITNESS: THEY HAVE A MORE--YES.

DEFENSE: AND SO IF SOMEONE HAS STEPPED IN BLOOD AND THE SHOES ARE NO LONGER MAKING IMPRESSIONS OF BLOODY SHOEPRINTS ON CEMENT, WHEN A PERSON STEPS ON FIBERS, THE FIBERS WILL GO INTO THE CREVICES OF THE SHOE?

DEFENSE: WHICH ONE DID YOU SWATCH?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL EXACTLY WHICH ONES I ASSISTED HER WITH, BUT THERE WERE PORTIONS OF STAINS WHERE IACTUALLY TOOK THE TWEEZERS AND DID THE MANIPULATION MYSELF.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?
P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: SO IT'S YOUR TESTIMONY OR IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY THAT ON JULY 6TH, YOU WENT AT THE REQUEST OF MISS CLARK AND YOU LOOKED FOR BLOODSTAINS ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE BRONCO DOOR?

P_WITNESS: NO. I DID SEE A STAIN THAT GAVE A POSITIVE FOR THE PRESENCE OF BLOOD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR SILL THERE.

DEFENSE: ISN'T IT TRUE, MR. FUNG, THAT YOU NEVER REMOVED ANYTHING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THAT BRONCO DOOR ON JULY 6TH FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING A PRESUMPTIVE TEST?
P_WITNESS: I DID PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON A DARK STAIN AT THE DOOR SILL OF THE DRIVER DOOR.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?

P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL EXACTLY WHICH ONES I ASSISTED HER WITH, BUT THERE WERE PORTIONS OF STAINS WHERE IACTUALLY TOOK THE TWEEZERS AND DID THE MANIPULATION MYSELF.

DEFENSE: ROCKINGHAM, SHE SWATCHED THE RED STAIN ON THE HANDLE OF THE BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: UNDER MY DIRECT SUPERVISION, YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, THE BUNDY GLOVE, GLOVE FOUND AT BUNDY --
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: ANDREA MAZZOLA WAS THE ONE THAT PICKED THAT UP, PUT IT IN THE BROWN PAPER BAG?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: THE WATCH CAP AT BUNDY, ANDREA MAZZOLA WAS THE PERSON WHO PICKED THAT UP AND PUT IT IN THE BAG?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR TESTIMONY AT THE GRAND JURY. DO YOU RECALL BEING ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AND WHO SWATCHED THEM? A AT BUNDY, YES. ""QUESTION: DID YOU ATTEMPT TO RETRIEVE AND PRESERVE THE BLOOD DRAWN THAT -- THAT'S BLOOD DROPS ""ANSWER: YES, I DID. ""QUESTION: WHAT DID YOU DO? ""ANSWER: I TRANSFERRED THE BLOOD DROPS ONTO CLOTH SQUARES OR CLOTH SWATCHES. WHAT I DID WAS WET THE CLOTH SWATCHES WITH DISTILLED WATER AND THEN APPLIED THEM TO THE STAIN, THE RED STAINS WHICH WERE LATER DETERMINED TO BE BLOOD, AND THEY WERE TRANSFERRED ON -- IN THAT METHOD."" WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
P_WITNESS: I WOULDN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY.

DEFENSE: YES. BUT SHE DID THE MOST.
P_WITNESS: SHE DID MOST OF IT, YES.

DEFENSE: WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF CRIME SCENE CONTAMINATION TO FIRST PROTECT THESCENE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?
P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: SO IT'S YOUR TESTIMONY OR IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY THAT ON JULY 6TH, YOU WENT AT THE REQUEST OF MISS CLARK AND YOU LOOKED FOR BLOODSTAINS ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE BRONCO DOOR?
P_WITNESS: THE EXTERIOR OF THE BRONCO DOOR BY THE DOOR SILL, YES.

DEFENSE: DID YOU CONDUCT A PRESUMPTIVE PHENOLPHTHALEIN TEST AND YOU GOT A POSITIVE RESULT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU NEVER SAW ANY RED STAINS ON THE BOTTOM OF THAT BRONCO DOOR ON JULY 6TH?
P_WITNESS: NO. I DID SEE A STAIN THAT GAVE A POSITIVE FOR THE PRESENCE OF BLOOD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR SILL THERE.

DEFENSE: ISN'T IT TRUE, MR. FUNG, THAT YOU NEVER REMOVED ANYTHING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THAT BRONCO DOOR ON JULY 6TH FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING A PRESUMPTIVE TEST?
P_WITNESS: I DID PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON A DARK STAIN AT THE DOOR SILL OF THE DRIVER DOOR.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I WENT THERE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE DRIVER DOOR SILL AND PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON IT.

DEFENSE: DID YOU TELL ANYONE ON AUGUST 8TH THAT YOU VISITED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 6TH TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL SAYING THAT.*****

DEFENSE: AND IS YOUR TESTIMONY, SIR, WITH RESPECT TO RED STAINS IN THE BRONCO THAT YOU'VE GIVEN TO THIS JURY IN ANY WAY MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO COVER FOR DETECTIVE FUHRMAN?
P_WITNESS: NO.*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, YOU'VE TOLD US THAT ON THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 13TH AT ROCKINGHAM, YOU RECEIVED MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD VIAL FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN RECOLLECT EXACTLY HOW THIS TRANSFER OCCURRED?
P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?
P_WITNESS: THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1995 9:20 A.M.

DEFENSE: ""QUESTION: I TAKE IT AT SOME POINT IN TIME, YOU LEFT THE FOYER AREA AND RETURNED TO YOUR CRIME SCENE TRUCK? ""ANSWER: YES. ""QUESTION: ALL RIGHT. AND WERE YOU CARRYING THAT GRAY ENVELOPE? ""ANSWER: EITHER BY ITSELF IN A POSSE BOX OR IN A PAPER BAG. ""QUESTION: SO IT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE THREE WAYS OF CARRYING IT; EITHER BY ITSELF IN YOUR HAND, IN A PAPER BAG OR IN A POSSE BOX? ""ANSWER: YES."" WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS AND DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS YESTERDAY?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND WHEN YOU SAW THESE SERIES OF TAPES, MR. FUNG, YOU REALIZED THAT YOU HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN A LIE, DIDN'T YOU?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: WELL, YOU HAD TOLD THIS JURY YESTERDAY THAT YOU CARRIED THE BLOOD VIAL--BLOOD SAMPLE EITHER IN A BROWN PAPER BAG IN THE POSSE BOX OR IN YOUR HANDS, CORRECT?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S WHAT I STATED.

DEFENSE: BUT WHEN YOU SAW THE VIDEOTAPE, THESE VIDEOTAPES, YOU REALIZED, SIR, THAT THAT--DETECTIVE VANNATTER'S CAR WASN'T THERE WHEN YOU PUT THE BROWN PAPER BAGS AND THE POSSE BOX WAS PUT IN THE REAR OF THE CRIME SCENE VEHICLE, CORRECT?
P_WITNESS: THE--I--THAT DIDN'T COME TO MY ATTENTION AT THAT TIME, NO.

DEFENSE: NOW, AT THIS POINT IN THE TIME, JUDGE ITO ASKED YOU WHAT WAS IN THE PLASTIC BAG BEING CARRIED BY MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD HIM THE GRAY MANILA ENVELOPE CONTAINING MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD SAMPLE?
P_WITNESS: I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE PLASTIC BAG.

DEFENSE: NOW, ON THIS DOCUMENT, YOU CAN READ ALONG IF IT HELPS, WITH YOUR COPY, IF YOU WANT, IT REFERS TO ITEM 17, ""ONE PAIR OF TENNIS SHOES, REEBOK, RECEIVED IN SEROLOGY BY D. FUNG FROM DETECTIVE LANGE,"" CORRECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: UP IN THE UPPER RIGHT-HAND CORNER JUST WHERE ""D. FUNG"" IS THERE IS A DATE, ""6/14/94""?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: AT SOME TIME AFTER JUNE 15TH DID ANYBODY EVER QUESTION YOU ABOUT HOW THE BLOOD VIAL HAD BEEN LABELED 18 IN MR. YAMAUCHI'S REPORTS BUT YOU PUT IT IN YOUR PROPERTY REPORT AS 17?
P_WITNESS: BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT IT, YES.

DEFENSE: AND THEN AFTER WRITING THAT NOTATION YOU DECIDED TO ERASE IT?
P_WITNESS: I DID ERASE IT FROM WHAT IS HERE, YES.

DEFENSE: AND IN GOING THROUGH THE PAGES OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST, YOU SAW ANOTHER DOCUMENT THAT CREATED A PROBLEM FOR YOU, DIDN'T YOU?
P_WITNESS: WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
P_WITNESS: WHAT ABOUT IT?

DEFENSE: IF THERE WERE SOMETHING FILLED IN THERE THAT SAID 5:15 AS TO THE TIME LEAVING SCENE, THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE GRAY ENVELOPE YOU RECEIVED FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?
P_WITNESS: IF THERE WAS THAT TIME THERE, YES, IT WOULD.

DEFENSE: AND THAT IS WHY YOU DESTROYED THE ORIGINAL PAGE 4, MR. FUNG?
P_WITNESS: THAT IS NOT TRUE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU EACH OF THE ORIGINALS OF THIS CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST. I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THEM AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THE UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF EACH OF THE PAGES AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE--LET ME PUT IT IN ORDER FOR YOU. ONE OF THOSE PAGES DOESN'T HAVE STAPLE HOLES IN IT, MR. FUNG?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT IS PAGE 4, ISN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT IS.

DEFENSE: THAT IS BECAUSE THAT PAGE 4 IS NOT THE ORIGINAL PAGE 4?
P_WITNESS: THAT IS APPARENT TO ME NOW, YES.

DEFENSE: HAVE YOU WATCHED ANY OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE TRIAL OF PRIOR WITNESSES?
P_WITNESS: YES, I HAVE.

DEFENSE: HAVE YOU PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED THAT YOU WENT OUT TO INSPECT THE BRONCO THE MORNING OF YOUR TESTIMONY OF THE PRELIMINARY HEARING WHICH WAS JULY 6TH?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: WERE YOU INFORMED BY MISS CLARK THAT A DETECTIVE HAD TESTIFIED TO SEEING RED STAINS ON THE DOOR SILL OF THE BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: SHE HAD TOLD ME THAT A DETECTIVE HAD TOLD HER THAT STAINS WERE VISIBLE FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BRONCO. *****

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU GAVE US TESTIMONY THAT THE FIBERS FROM A CARPET CAN GET INTO THE CREVICES OF SHOES?
P_WITNESS: THEY HAVE A MORE--YES.

DEFENSE: AND SO IF SOMEONE HAS STEPPED IN BLOOD AND THE SHOES ARE NO LONGER MAKING IMPRESSIONS OF BLOODY SHOEPRINTS ON CEMENT, WHEN A PERSON STEPS ON FIBERS, THE FIBERS WILL GO INTO THE CREVICES OF THE SHOE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WOULD BE TRUE FOR THE SHOES OF A POLICE OFFICER WHO HAD STEPPED IN BLOOD AS IT WOULD BE FOR ANY OTHER PERSON WEARING SHOES?
P_WITNESS: IF THAT WAS--YEAH. IT IS LIKELY.

DEFENSE: NOW, THE MAT IN THE CAR, THE BRONCO, IT DOESN'T HAVE FIBERS?
