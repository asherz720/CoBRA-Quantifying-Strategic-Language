In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that Andrea Mazzola was primarily responsible for collecting blood samples at the Bundy crime scene and questioned the accuracy of P_Witness's previous statements regarding their involvement in the evidence collection process.

   - **Witness Claim:** P_Witness acknowledged Mazzola's significant role in collecting evidence but insisted that they also participated in the process, albeit to a lesser extent. They maintained that their testimony about the collection methods was accurate, even if they could not recall specific details.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that Andrea Mazzola was primarily responsible for collecting blood samples at the Bundy crime scene and questioned the accuracy of P_Witness's previous statements regarding their involvement in the evidence collection process. They highlighted the importance of proper crime scene management to avoid contamination.
   - **Witness Claim:** P_Witness acknowledged Mazzola's significant role in collecting evidence but insisted that they also participated in the process, albeit to a lesser extent. They confirmed the importance of protecting the crime scene and expressed that they would object to any procedures that could compromise evidence integrity.

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to challenge the credibility of the evidence collection process and the witness's testimony while the witness attempted to assert their role and the adherence to proper procedures.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper evidence collection procedures to avoid contamination and highlighted that Andrea Mazzola was primarily responsible for collecting blood samples at the Bundy crime scene. They questioned the accuracy of P_Witness's previous statements regarding Mazzola's training and the extent of her involvement.
   - **Witness Claim:** P_Witness acknowledged Mazzola's significant role in collecting evidence but maintained that he also participated in the process. He confirmed that he was present during the collection of blood drops and that he had concerns about contamination but did not recall specific details about his actions.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's training and her role in evidence collection. The defense suggested that Mazzola was still in training during the events, while P_Witness insisted she was a criminalist.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?

P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper crime scene management to prevent contamination and highlighted inconsistencies in the witness's testimony regarding who collected blood samples and other evidence. They argued that Andrea Mazzola primarily collected the blood samples and that there were significant delays and potential mishandling of evidence, such as the blood samples being left in a hot truck for several hours.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged the principles of crime scene protection and confirmed that he was present during the evidence collection process. He admitted that Mazzola collected most of the blood samples but insisted that he also participated in the collection process, albeit to a lesser extent.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the accuracy of the witness's previous statements regarding Mazzola's training status and the extent of her involvement in collecting evidence. The defense suggested that the witness was reluctant to fully acknowledge Mazzola's role.
   - The defense questioned the witness about the timing of his arrival at the crime scenes and the implications of that timing on the integrity of the evidence collected. The witness confirmed delays in arriving at the scenes, which the defense argued could have compromised the evidence.
   - The defense raised concerns about the potential for cross-contamination of evidence, particularly regarding a blanket that was placed at the crime scene, and the witness acknowledged that this could be a source of contamination.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's handling of blood samples, questioning the appropriateness of leaving them in a hot truck and the implications of that for the evidence's integrity. The witness admitted that it could be considered a mistake not to use the refrigerator in the truck.

Overall, the defense aimed to undermine the credibility of the evidence collection process and the witness's reliability, while the witness maintained that he followed proper procedures, albeit with some admissions of potential errors.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that the integrity of the crime scene was compromised due to improper handling and collection of evidence, particularly by Andrea Mazzola, who they argued was primarily responsible for collecting blood samples and other evidence.

   - The defense questioned the witness's recollection of events, particularly regarding the timeline of their arrival at the crime scenes and the handling of evidence, suggesting that the witness's previous statements were inconsistent.
   - The defense also raised concerns about the potential for contamination due to the handling of evidence, such as a blanket that could have transferred hairs and fibers, while the witness acknowledged the possibility but did not fully agree with the defense's implications of negligence.
   - The defense sought to undermine the credibility of the witness by suggesting he was covering for other detectives and had been caught in inconsistencies regarding the handling of blood evidence, which the witness denied.

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
P_WITNESS: I WOULDN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY.

DEFENSE: YES. BUT SHE DID THE MOST.
P_WITNESS: SHE DID MOST OF IT, YES.

DEFENSE: WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF CRIME SCENE CONTAMINATION TO FIRST PROTECT THESCENE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?
P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper evidence collection procedures to avoid contamination and questioned the witness's reliability and accuracy in recounting the evidence collection process, particularly regarding Andrea Mazzola's role in swatching blood drops and the handling of evidence at the crime scenes.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged the principles of crime scene preservation and confirmed that he was present during the evidence collection, asserting that he performed some functions but could not recall specifics about which blood stains he swatched.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement about the extent of Mazzola's involvement in collecting blood evidence, with the defense suggesting she was primarily responsible while the witness conceded she did a good portion but not exclusively.
   - The defense questioned the witness's response time to the crime scene and whether it was appropriate, suggesting that delays could compromise evidence integrity. The witness confirmed the timeline but did not acknowledge any wrongdoing.
   - The defense raised concerns about the potential for cross-contamination of evidence, particularly regarding a blanket used at the crime scene and the handling of blood samples, while the witness acknowledged the risks but did not concede that any mistakes were made.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's recollection of events and the accuracy of his previous testimonies, suggesting inconsistencies in his statements about the handling of evidence, particularly regarding the blood vial from Mr. Simpson.

Overall, the defense aimed to undermine the credibility of the witness and the procedures followed during evidence collection, while the witness maintained that he acted within the protocols of crime scene investigation.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that the integrity of the crime scene was compromised due to improper handling and collection of evidence, particularly by Andrea Mazzola, who they argued primarily collected blood samples and other evidence without adequate supervision or proper procedure.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintained that he was present during the evidence collection and that while Mazzola did collect a significant portion of the evidence, he also participated in the process. He asserted that he followed proper procedures and that any mistakes were not significant enough to undermine the overall integrity of the evidence.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's experience and role in collecting evidence. The defense suggested that she was still in training and not qualified to handle the evidence, while the witness insisted she was a criminalist and capable of performing her duties.
   - The defense questioned the timing and conditions under which evidence was collected, particularly the blood samples, suggesting that delays and improper storage could have led to contamination. The witness acknowledged some issues but defended the overall process as acceptable.
   - The defense also raised concerns about the potential for cross-contamination of evidence, particularly regarding a blanket found at the crime scene, while the witness acknowledged the possibility but did not concede that it was a definitive issue.
   - The defense attempted to highlight inconsistencies in the witness's previous testimonies and statements regarding the handling of blood samples, suggesting that the witness was not being truthful or was confused about the events. The witness denied any intent to mislead the court.

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant disputes over the handling of evidence, the qualifications of the personnel involved, and the potential for contamination, which are critical to the defense's argument regarding the integrity of the evidence presented in the case.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU TESTIFIED PREVIOUSLY IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR, DIDN'T YOU TELL US THAT ANDREA MAZZOLA ON JUNE 13TH WAS STILL IN TRAINING?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T REMEMBER MY EXACT WORDS.

DEFENSE: ISN'T IT TRUE THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 55 AND 56, THAT MISS MAZZOLA WAS THE ONE WHO SWATCHED EVERY BLOODSTAIN AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE, NO.

DEFENSE: WHICH ONE DID YOU SWATCH?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL EXACTLY WHICH ONES I ASSISTED HER WITH, BUT THERE WERE PORTIONS OF STAINS WHERE IACTUALLY TOOK THE TWEEZERS AND DID THE MANIPULATION MYSELF.

WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I WENT THERE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE DRIVER DOOR SILL AND PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON IT.

DEFENSE: DID YOU TELL ANYONE ON AUGUST 8TH THAT YOU VISITED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 6TH TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL SAYING THAT.*****

P_WITNESS: NO.*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, YOU'VE TOLD US THAT ON THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 13TH AT ROCKINGHAM, YOU RECEIVED MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD VIAL FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN RECOLLECT EXACTLY HOW THIS TRANSFER OCCURRED?
P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?
P_WITNESS: THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1995 9:20 A.M.

P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

P_WITNESS: I DID PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON A DARK STAIN AT THE DOOR SILL OF THE DRIVER DOOR.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I WENT THERE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE DRIVER DOOR SILL AND PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON IT.

DEFENSE: DID YOU TELL ANYONE ON AUGUST 8TH THAT YOU VISITED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 6TH TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL SAYING THAT.*****

P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper evidence collection procedures to avoid contamination and questioned the witness's reliability and accuracy in recounting the evidence collection process, particularly regarding Andrea Mazzola's role in swatching blood drops and the handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that the integrity of the crime scene was compromised due to improper handling and collection of evidence, particularly by Andrea Mazzola, who was alleged to have primarily collected blood samples. They argued that the procedures followed could lead to contamination and questioned the witness's reliability and accuracy in recounting events.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintained that he was present during the evidence collection and that he performed some functions himself, although he could not recall specifics. He acknowledged that Mazzola collected a significant portion of the blood samples but insisted that he acted under proper supervision and followed protocols.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's experience and role in collecting evidence, with the defense suggesting she was still in training while the witness claimed she was a criminalist. 
   - The defense questioned the witness's recollection of events, particularly regarding the collection of blood samples and the timeline of their arrival at the crime scenes, suggesting that delays and mishandling could have compromised evidence integrity.
   - The witness acknowledged potential issues with contamination, particularly concerning a blanket used at the crime scene, but the defense argued that the failure to analyze the blanket was a significant oversight.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's credibility by suggesting inconsistencies in his testimony about the handling of blood samples and the circumstances surrounding their collection, implying that he may have been trying to cover for other detectives involved in the case. 

Overall, the defense aimed to undermine the reliability of the evidence collected, while the witness defended the procedures followed during the investigation.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE, NO.

P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL EXACTLY WHICH ONES I ASSISTED HER WITH, BUT THERE WERE PORTIONS OF STAINS WHERE IACTUALLY TOOK THE TWEEZERS AND DID THE MANIPULATION MYSELF.

WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?

DEFENSE: WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF CRIME SCENE CONTAMINATION TO FIRST PROTECT THESCENE?

P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I WENT THERE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE DRIVER DOOR SILL AND PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON IT.

DEFENSE: DID YOU TELL ANYONE ON AUGUST 8TH THAT YOU VISITED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 6TH TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL SAYING THAT.*****

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN RECOLLECT EXACTLY HOW THIS TRANSFER OCCURRED?
P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?
P_WITNESS: THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1995 9:20 A.M.

""ANSWER: I TRANSFERRED THE BLOOD DROPS ONTO CLOTH SQUARES OR CLOTH SWATCHES. WHAT I DID WAS WET THE CLOTH SWATCHES WITH DISTILLED WATER AND THEN APPLIED THEM TO THE STAIN, THE RED STAINS WHICH WERE LATER DETERMINED TO BE BLOOD, AND THEY WERE TRANSFERRED ON -- IN THAT METHOD."" WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
P_WITNESS: I WOULDN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY.

DEFENSE: YES. BUT SHE DID THE MOST.
P_WITNESS: SHE DID MOST OF IT, YES.

DEFENSE: WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF CRIME SCENE CONTAMINATION TO FIRST PROTECT THESCENE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?
P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I WENT THERE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE DRIVER DOOR SILL AND PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON IT.

DEFENSE: DID YOU TELL ANYONE ON AUGUST 8TH THAT YOU VISITED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 6TH TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL SAYING THAT.*****

P_WITNESS: NO.*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, YOU'VE TOLD US THAT ON THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 13TH AT ROCKINGHAM, YOU RECEIVED MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD VIAL FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN RECOLLECT EXACTLY HOW THIS TRANSFER OCCURRED?
P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?
P_WITNESS: THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1995 9:20 A.M.

DEFENSE: ""QUESTION: I TAKE IT AT SOME POINT IN TIME, YOU LEFT THE FOYER AREA AND RETURNED TO YOUR CRIME SCENE TRUCK? ""ANSWER: YES. ""QUESTION: ALL RIGHT. AND WERE YOU CARRYING THAT GRAY ENVELOPE?

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper evidence collection procedures to avoid contamination and questioned the witness's reliability and accuracy in recounting the evidence collection process, particularly regarding Andrea Mazzola's role in swatching blood drops and the handling of evidence at the crime scenes.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintained that he was present during the evidence collection and that he performed some functions, although he could not recall specifics. He acknowledged that Mazzola collected a significant portion of the blood samples but insisted that he also contributed to the process.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper evidence collection procedures to avoid contamination, questioning the witness about the actions of Andrea Mazzola and the handling of blood samples. They suggested that Mazzola primarily collected the blood samples and that there were significant lapses in protocol that could have compromised the integrity of the evidence.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged that Mazzola collected many blood samples but insisted that he also participated in the collection process. He maintained that the procedures followed were generally appropriate, although he admitted to some uncertainties regarding specific details.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's training and her role in collecting evidence. The defense suggested that she was still in training during the critical evidence collection phases, while the witness claimed she was a criminalist and competent in her role.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
P_WITNESS: WHAT ABOUT IT?

DEFENSE: AND THAT IS WHY YOU DESTROYED THE ORIGINAL PAGE 4, MR. FUNG?
