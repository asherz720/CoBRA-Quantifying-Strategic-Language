","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether protecting the crime scene is a principle to prevent contamination, and the witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear and direct answer. That seems like a beneficial commitment because it supports the defense's point, so I think it's a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness agreed without hesitation, which makes me think they're being truthful. So that's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony isn't mentioned here, so I can't say if it's consistent or not. But since there's no info, I'll assume it's consistent, so 0.

Relevance is high because the question is directly about crime scene contamination, which is very relevant to the case. So that's a 1.

Clarity is very clear because the answer is a simple ""YES"" without any hedging. So that's a 1.

The outcome of this turn benefits the questioner, which is the defense, because the witness agreed to their point. So the winner is the Questioner.

The reason for the outcome is that the witness's agreement supports the defense's argument, so it's based on logical arguments being convincing. That's reason 1.

In the previous court conversation, the defense emphasized the importance of protecting a crime scene to prevent contamination, suggesting that this principle is fundamental in criminal investigations. The witness agreed with this claim, indicating a consensus on the necessity of safeguarding the integrity of a crime scene.

However, the underlying conflict may arise from differing interpretations of how well this principle was applied in the specific case at hand, which could lead to disagreements about the validity of evidence collected and the overall investigation process. The defense's assertion implies potential shortcomings in the handling of the crime scene, which may be contested by the prosecution or other witnesses.

","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the defense attorney asked the witness if they agree that protecting the crime scene is a principle to prevent contamination. The witness answered ""YES."" Then, the defense followed up by asking if the witness took great pains to testify that they observed Miss Mazzola collect all the blood drops, including 52. The witness again responded with ""YES.""

I need to evaluate this response based on seven properties. Let's go through each one.

1. **Witness Commitment Level**: The witness answered ""YES"" both times. This seems like a strong affirmation, so it's a beneficial commitment for the witness because it supports their testimony. So, I think it's a 2.

2. **Witness Truthfulness**: The response is straightforward without any signs of hesitation or deception. It seems truthful, so I'll mark it as 1.

3. **Consistency with Previous Testimony**: The witness was consistent in both answers, so it's consistent. That's a 0.

4. **Response Relevance**: The question is directly about the collection of evidence, which is very relevant to the case. So, relevance is 1.

5. **Response Clarity**: The answer is a simple ""YES,"" very clear without any ambiguity. Clarity is 1.

6. **Current Turn Outcome**: The witness's affirmative answer supports their own credibility, so the witness wins this turn.

7. **Reason for Outcome**: The witness provided a clear and consistent answer, which are logical arguments. So, reason is 1.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is clear, consistent, and relevant, making their side more convincing in this turn.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's current response in this cross-examination. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the defense attorney is questioning the witness about whether they saw Miss Mazzola collect all the blood drops, including 52. The witness had previously testified that they observed her collect all those drops, but now they're saying they didn't see her collect 52. The witness's response is, ""I was present during those phases of the collection process.""

Looking at commitment level, the witness is stating they were present but doesn't directly answer whether they saw the collection of 52. So, they're not making a clear commitment either way. That seems like a neutral commitment, so I'll go with 3.

For truthfulness, the witness is being truthful about their presence but avoiding a direct answer. So, I think they're still being truthful, so that's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness said they saw her collect all, including 52, but now they're saying they didn't see that part. That's inconsistent, so consistency_value is 1.

Response relevance: The answer is somewhat relevant because it addresses presence but not the specific collection of 52. So, slightly relevant, which is 2.

Clarity: The response is a bit unclear because it doesn't directly answer the question. It's slightly unclear, so manner_rate is 3.

Outcome: The questioner (defense) is trying to point out inconsistency, so the witness's unclear answer might not help their case. So, the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The witness's inconsistency and unclear answer make the questioner's point more convincing. So, it's a credibility attack, which is reason 2.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreement:**
   - The defense is challenging the credibility of the evidence collection process, particularly focusing on the collection of blood drop 52, suggesting that it may not have been collected properly or at all.
   - The witness's testimony creates a conflict as they affirm the collection of blood drops but also indicate a lack of direct observation of the collection of the specific drop in question, which raises doubts about the completeness of the evidence collection.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness remembered a specific statement they made earlier, where they were asked if Andrea Mazzola is a trainee and they answered that she's a criminalist. The witness responded with ""YES.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear affirmation. This seems to be a beneficial commitment because it supports the witness's previous testimony, making their statement more consistent. So, I think the commitment level is 2.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness is confirming their previous statement. There's no indication they're being dishonest here, so I'll mark it as truthful, which is 1.

Looking at consistency, the witness is agreeing with their earlier testimony. This means it's consistent, so that's a 0.

For relevance, the question is about the witness's memory of their prior statement, which is directly related to the case. It's very relevant, so that's a 1.

Clarity-wise, the response is a simple ""YES,"" which is very clear. No hedging or ambiguity, so that's a 1.

Now, determining the outcome of this turn. The witness's clear and consistent answer supports their credibility, so the witness gains the upper hand here. Therefore, the outcome is in favor of the witness.

The reason for this outcome is the logical consistency and clarity of the witness's response, which makes their testimony more believable. So, the reason is based on logical arguments being convincing.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties step by step.

First, the commitment level. The witness says, ""I don't remember my exact words."" This doesn't commit them to either agreeing or disagreeing with the question. They're not taking a clear stance, so it's a neutral commitment. That would be a 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is claiming they don't remember their exact words from a previous testimony. It's possible they genuinely don't recall, but it's also possible they're avoiding the question. Without more context, it's hard to say, but I'm leaning towards them not being entirely truthful because they might be trying to avoid inconsistency. So, I'll rate this as 0 for not truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony is tricky here. The defense is pointing out that the witness previously said Andrea Mazzola was in training, but now the witness doesn't remember. This creates inconsistency because the witness's current response doesn't align with their past statement. So, this is a 1 for inconsistent.

Response relevance is high because the question is directly about the witness's previous testimony, which is very relevant to the case. So, I'll give this a 1 for very relevant.

Clarity of the response is slightly unclear because the witness is hedging by saying they don't remember. It's not a direct answer, so it's a 3 for slightly unclear.

The outcome of this turn seems to favor the questioner (the defense) because the witness's lack of memory could undermine their credibility. The defense is trying to show inconsistency, so they're benefiting here. Therefore, the outcome is the questioner.

The reason for this outcome is the credibility attack. The defense is attacking the witness's credibility by pointing out potential inconsistencies, which makes the witness's response less believable. So, the reason is 2.

Putting it all together, the witness's response isn't helping their case and is instead aiding the defense in casting doubt on their reliability.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties step by step.

First, the commitment level. The witness says, ""THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE, NO."" This seems like a clear disagreement with the question. So, the witness is making a commitment here, but it's against the questioner's statement. That would be a beneficial commitment for the witness, so I think it's a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is contradicting the defense's assertion. Without knowing the exact facts, it's hard to say if they're lying, but their response is direct. I'll assume they're being truthful, so 1.

Consistency with previous testimony. Earlier, the witness said Andrea Mazzola was a criminalist, but in August, they mentioned she was in training. Now, they're challenging the defense's point about her collecting bloodstains. This seems inconsistent, so 1.

Response relevance. The witness is directly addressing the question about who collected the bloodstains, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

Clarity of response. The answer is straightforward and clear, so that's a 1.

Outcome of the turn. The witness is challenging the defense's point, so the witness gains the upper hand here. Outcome is Witness.

Reason for outcome. The witness used logical arguments to counter the question, making their point convincing. So, reason 1.

DEFENSE: WHICH ONE DID YOU SWATCH?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question from the defense was about which bloodstains the witness swatched. The witness answered that they don't recall exactly which ones they assisted with, but there were portions where they used tweezers themselves. 

Looking at commitment level, the witness is providing some information but hedges by saying they don't recall exactly. This seems like a neutral commitment because they're not firmly stating which ones they did, so it's a 3.

For truthfulness, the witness is being honest about not remembering the exact stains, which sounds truthful. So that's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness said they were present during collection but didn't specify which ones they handled. Now, they're saying they did some, but not exactly which. This seems consistent, so 0.

Relevance: The response directly addresses the question about which stains they swatched, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

Clarity: The witness is clear that they don't remember exactly but did assist in some parts. There's a bit of hedging, so slightly clear with hedging, which is a 2.

Outcome: The witness provided a reasonable answer without fully committing, so the witness maintains their position. Outcome is Witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness used a credibility attack by pointing out their own role, which slightly weakens the defense's point. So reason is 2.

DEFENSE: ROCKINGHAM, SHE SWATCHED THE RED STAIN ON THE HANDLE OF THE BRONCO?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether Rockingham swatched the red stain on the handle of the Bronco, and the witness answered, ""Under my direct supervision, yes."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is affirming that Rockingham did the swatching, but adds that it was under their supervision. This seems like a beneficial commitment because it clarifies that they were overseeing the process, which might imply that they take responsibility for the accuracy of the action. So, I think the commitment level is 2, beneficial.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems to be stating a fact about supervision, which is a specific detail. There's no obvious contradiction here, so I'll mark it as truthful, which is 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned that they assisted with some swatches but didn't recall exactly which ones. Now, they're saying Rockingham did it under their supervision. This seems consistent because they're not contradicting their earlier statement; they're just providing more detail. So, consistency is 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about who swatched the stain, so the answer is very relevant. Relevance rate is 1.

Response clarity: The answer is clear and direct, without hedging. So, clarity is 1.

Outcome of the current turn: The witness provided a clear and specific answer, which supports their credibility. So, the outcome favors the witness.

Reason for the outcome: The witness used logical arguments by specifying their role in supervision, which makes their testimony more convincing. So, the reason is 1.

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a direct ""YES,"" which is a clear affirmation.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: THE WATCH CAP AT BUNDY, ANDREA MAZZOLA WAS THE PERSON WHO PICKED THAT UP AND PUT IT IN THE BAG?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether Andrea Mazzola picked up the watch cap at Bundy and put it in the bag, and the witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a direct ""YES,"" which is a clear and firm answer. That seems like a beneficial commitment for the questioner because it supports the defense's line of questioning. So, I think the commitment level is 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in acknowledging Mazzola's role in collecting evidence. There's no indication here that the witness is being untruthful, so I'll mark that as 1.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, earlier the witness mentioned that Mazzola was under their supervision and handled some evidence. This current answer aligns with that, so it's consistent. Therefore, consistency is 0.

The response is very relevant because it directly answers the question about who handled the watch cap, which is a key piece of evidence. So relevance is 1.

Clarity-wise, the answer is a simple ""YES,"" which is very clear. No hedging or uncertainty, so clarity is 1.

As for the outcome, the questioner (defense) seems to be getting the information they wanted, which could support their case. So the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

The reason for this outcome is that the witness's answer supports the defense's points, likely through logical arguments showing Mazzola's involvement, which might be relevant to their case strategy. So the reason is 1.

WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the question is about whether the witness was asked specific questions at the grand jury and if they gave certain answers. The witness responds with ""YES, I DID."" That seems pretty straightforward. They're confirming that they were asked those questions and that they provided those answers. 

Looking at the commitment level, the witness is agreeing directly to the question without any hesitation or hedging. So that's a beneficial commitment for the questioner because it supports the line of questioning. I think that's a level 2.

For truthfulness, the witness is affirming their previous testimony, so unless there's evidence they're lying, I have to assume they're being truthful. So that's a 1.

Consistency is a bit tricky. Earlier, the witness said they were present during the collection phases but didn't see Miss Mazzola collect 52. Now, they're confirming their grand jury testimony where they took credit for transferring blood drops. This seems inconsistent because earlier they downplayed their involvement, but now they're confirming they did the transferring. So that's inconsistent, which is a 1.

Relevance is high because the question is directly about their previous testimony, which is very relevant to the case. So that's a 1.

Clarity is very clear because the response is a direct ""yes"" without any ambiguity. So that's a 1.

The outcome of this turn favors the questioner because the witness is confirming their previous statements, which the defense can use to challenge their credibility. So the winner is the Questioner.

The reason for this outcome is that the questioner is using the witness's own words against them, which is a credibility attack. So that's reason 2.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the witness is being asked about their previous testimony regarding blood drops at Bundy. The defense attorney is pointing out that the witness's current testimony might not be accurate. The witness responds by saying their testimony was accurate in that they performed some functions, but they don't recall exactly which ones.

Looking at commitment level, the witness seems to be hedging. They're not fully committing to the accuracy of their previous testimony, which could be detrimental because it might make their earlier statements seem unreliable. So I think the commitment level is 1, detrimental.

Regarding truthfulness, the witness is being vague. They admit they don't recall exactly, which makes their statement less credible. So I'd rate truthfulness as 0, not truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony is an issue here. The witness is now saying they don't remember which blood drops they handled, which contradicts their earlier grand jury testimony where they took credit for transferring the blood drops. So consistency is 1, inconsistent.

The response is relevant because it directly addresses the question about the accuracy of their previous testimony. So relevance is 1, very relevant.

Clarity-wise, the witness is using phrases like ""I don't recall exactly,"" which introduces uncertainty. It's slightly clear but with some hedging, so clarity is 2.

As for the outcome, the questioner (defense) seems to be gaining the upper hand because the witness's credibility is being challenged. The witness's lack of recall and inconsistency help the defense's case. So the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

The reason for this outcome is the credibility attack. The defense is pointing out inconsistencies and lack of recall, which undermines the witness's reliability. So the reason is 2, credibility attack.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is detrimental, not entirely truthful, inconsistent, relevant but not very clear, and the questioner benefits due to credibility issues.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness swatched one or two of the Bundy blood drops, and the witness replied, ""MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is hedging by saying ""may have been,"" which isn't a definite yes or no. So, it's a bit of a non-committal answer, which I think is a Neutral commitment, so that's a 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems to be adjusting their previous statement, which could indicate they're being truthful about not remembering exactly. But it's a bit unclear, so I'm leaning towards truthful, which is 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness said they might have swatched one or two, but now they're saying it could have been more. That's inconsistent, so that's a 1.

Response relevance: The answer is directly addressing the question about the number of blood drops swatched, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

Clarity: The response uses ""may have been,"" which is a bit hedgy, so it's slightly clear with hedging. That's a 2.

Outcome: The witness is clarifying their previous statement, which might help their credibility, so the outcome favors the Witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness is providing a more accurate recollection, which is a logical argument, so reason 1.

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is agreeing but not fully committing to ""primarily all."" Using ""a good portion"" is a bit vague, so it's a neutral commitment, maybe a 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems to be honest here, acknowledging Mazzola's role without overstating it. So, I'll rate that as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness said Mazzola did a good portion, which is consistent. So, 0 for consistent.

Relevance: The response is directly answering the question, so it's very relevant, a 1.

Clarity: The answer is clear but uses ""a good portion,"" which is slightly hedged. So, clarity is slightly clear with hedging, a 2.

Outcome: The questioner is trying to establish that Mazzola handled most of the evidence. The witness's answer supports that, so the questioner benefits. Outcome is Questioner.

Reason for outcome: The witness's admission helps the questioner's case, so it's a credibility attack on the other side, reason 2.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether Andrea Mazzola did the Rockingham blood stains exclusively, and the witness answered, ""I wouldn't say exclusively."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is hedging by saying ""I wouldn't say exclusively,"" which means they're not fully committing to the idea that Mazzola did all the Rockingham stains. This seems like a neutral commitment because they're not clearly agreeing or disagreeing. So, I think the commitment level is 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems to be honest here because they're clarifying that Mazzola didn't do all the stains, which aligns with their previous testimony where they mentioned assisting with some. So, I'll rate truthfulness as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness said Mazzola did a good portion but not all, and now they're saying not exclusively. That's consistent, so consistency is 0.

Response relevance: The answer directly addresses the question about who handled the Rockingham stains, so it's very relevant. Relevance rate is 1.

Response clarity: The witness uses ""I wouldn't say exclusively,"" which is slightly hedging but still clear enough. So, clarity is 2.

Outcome: The witness is maintaining their position without fully conceding, so the witness wins this turn.

Reason for outcome: The witness is using a credibility attack by clarifying that Mazzola didn't do all the work, which undermines the defense's point. So, reason is 2.

Outcome: The questioner (defense) benefits because the witness is confirming that Mazzola did most of the work, which could imply she was more experienced. So the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The witness's agreement supports the defense's line of questioning, so it's based on logical arguments, reason 1.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether protecting the crime scene is a principle to prevent contamination, and the witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear and direct answer. That seems like a beneficial commitment because it supports the defense's line of questioning about proper crime scene procedures. So, I think the commitment level is 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness agreed that protecting the scene is a principle, which is a standard forensic practice. So, this seems truthful. I'll rate it as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness had discussed their role and the role of Andrea Mazzola in collecting evidence. This question is more about a general principle, so it doesn't directly contradict or support previous statements. Therefore, it's consistent, so 0.

Response relevance: The question is about crime scene contamination, which is very relevant to the case, especially since the defense is questioning the collection process. So, relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The answer was a simple ""YES,"" very clear without any hedging. So, clarity is 1.

Outcome: The questioner (defense) seems to benefit because the witness is agreeing to a key principle that the defense is emphasizing. So, the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The defense is using this to establish credibility on crime scene procedures, which is a logical argument. So, reason is 1.

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness would object if they saw detectives using procedures that could impair evidence integrity. The witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a direct ""YES,"" which is a clear and firm answer. That seems like a beneficial commitment because it supports the defense's line of questioning, implying the witness would take action to protect evidence. So, I think the commitment level is 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in acknowledging their role and Andrea Mazzola's role in collecting evidence. This ""YES"" aligns with their previous statements about proper procedures, so I believe it's truthful. That's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: The witness has been consistent about their oversight and the collection process. This answer doesn't contradict earlier statements, so it's consistent. That's a 0.

Response relevance: The question is about objecting to improper procedures, which is directly relevant to the case's evidence handling. So, it's very relevant, a 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a straightforward ""YES"" without any hedging, so it's very clear. That's a 1.

Outcome: The witness's clear and affirmative answer supports the defense's point, so the outcome favors the Questioner (Defense). 

Reason for outcome: The answer is based on logical arguments about proper evidence handling, which makes the defense's case stronger. So, reason 1.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is describing their protocol, which seems straightforward and factual. There's no indication they're being dishonest, so I'll mark that as truthful, a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony. Earlier, the witness talked about protecting the scene and their procedures. This response aligns with that, so it's consistent. That's a 0.

Relevance. The question is about the requirement for criminalists to arrive quickly. The witness's answer directly addresses that by stating their response time, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

Clarity. The response is clear and straightforward without hedging, so it's very clear. That's a 1.

Outcome. The witness provided a clear, relevant answer that supports their credibility. So, the witness wins this turn.

Reason for outcome. The witness used logical arguments by explaining their standard procedure, which is convincing. So, reason 1.

P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether Miss Mazzola called the witness at 5:30, and the witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear affirmation. This seems to be a beneficial commitment because it directly answers the question without hedging, so I think it's a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in acknowledging Miss Mazzola's role and the timeline, so I don't see any red flags here. It seems truthful, so that's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned that Miss Mazzola was involved in collecting evidence and that she was called. This ""YES"" aligns with that, so it's consistent. That's a 0.

Response relevance: The question is about the timeline and who called whom, which is directly relevant to establishing the sequence of events. So, very relevant, which is a 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a simple ""YES,"" very clear without any ambiguity. That's a 1.

Outcome of the turn: The questioner gets the information they wanted, so the questioner wins this turn.

Reason for the outcome: The answer is clear and directly supports the questioner's line of inquiry, so it's based on logical arguments being convincing. That's reason 1.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about the time the witness arrived at the Rockingham scene, and the witness answered ""7:10."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a specific time, which is a clear and direct answer. That seems like a beneficial commitment because it provides the information the questioner asked for without hesitation. So, I think the commitment level is 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness provided a precise time, which suggests they're being truthful. There's no indication of evasion or lying here, so I'll mark that as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony is a bit tricky. Earlier, the witness mentioned that they arrived at Rockingham, but I don't recall the exact time being discussed before. Since the time ""7:10"" hasn't been contradicted in the provided transcript, I'll assume it's consistent, so 0.

Relevance is high because the time of arrival is directly related to the question. It's very relevant, so that's a 1.

Clarity is also very clear. The witness gave a straightforward answer without any hedging, so that's a 1.

As for the outcome, the questioner asked for a specific fact, and the witness provided it. This helps the questioner's case, so the outcome favors the questioner. The reason is that the witness provided a logical and clear answer, which supports the questioner's line of inquiry.

Putting it all together, the witness's clear and truthful answer benefits the questioner by providing the necessary information without any issues.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about the response time to the crime scene at Rockingham, and the witness answered, ""YES, IT WAS."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is directly agreeing with the question, which seems to be a clear and firm commitment. Since this admission could potentially be used against them, it might be detrimental, so I think it's a 1.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent about the timeline, so I believe they're being truthful here. That's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned the response time, and this answer aligns with that. So, consistent, which is 0.

Response relevance: The question is about the response time, which is directly relevant to the case, so very relevant, a 1.

Response clarity: The answer is straightforward without any hedging, so very clear, a 1.

Outcome: The questioner is getting a clear answer that could be used to challenge the witness's credibility regarding their promptness. So, the questioner wins this turn.

Reason for outcome: The answer is a logical admission that could impact the witness's credibility, so it's based on logical arguments.

   - **Witness Claim:** P_WITNESS acknowledged Mazzola's significant role in collecting blood samples but maintained that he also participated in the process, albeit to a lesser extent. He confirmed that he was present during the collection and that Mazzola was not a trainee at the time.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the accuracy of the witness's previous testimony regarding Mazzola's training status and the extent of her involvement in collecting blood samples. The defense suggested that the witness was reluctant to fully acknowledge Mazzola's primary role.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether Detective Vannatter told the witness that Detective Lange was waiting at Bundy. The witness answered, ""I don't specifically recall if he mentioned it was Detective Lange himself, but he did mention there was another scene at Bundy.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is being cautious by saying they don't specifically recall the exact mention of Lange's name. This seems like a neutral commitment because they're not firmly agreeing or disagreeing, just stating what they remember.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is being honest about their memory, acknowledging that they don't recall the specific detail about Lange. So, I think they're being truthful here.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned that Vannatter told them about another scene at Bundy, but didn't specify Lange. So, this is consistent with what they said before.

Response relevance: The answer is relevant because it addresses the question about what Vannatter told them, even though it doesn't confirm Lange specifically. So, it's slightly relevant.

Clarity: The response is slightly clear but has some hedging with phrases like ""I don't specifically recall."" It's not very clear because of that hedging.

Outcome: The questioner might not get the specific confirmation they were looking for, so the witness maintains their position without giving away more than they can recall.

Reason for outcome: The witness's cautious and hedged response means they aren't providing the clear confirmation the questioner wanted, so the witness benefits here.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether Detective Vannatter told the witness that at the Bundy scene, there was a double homicide with two victims' bodies. The witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear and direct answer. That seems like a high commitment because it's a definitive response without any hedging. So, I think the commitment level is 1, which is detrimental to the questioner because it supports the defense's point.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in their previous testimony about the events, so I don't see any immediate red flags. They've been answering accurately based on what's been discussed before. So, I'll rate truthfulness as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: The witness has mentioned other details about the crime scenes and their interactions with other detectives. This ""YES"" doesn't contradict anything they've said before, so it's consistent. Therefore, consistency is 0.

Response relevance: The question is about what Detective Vannatter told the witness regarding the Bundy scene. This is directly relevant to the case as it pertains to the crime scene details and the handling of evidence. So, relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a simple ""YES,"" which is very clear. There's no ambiguity here, so clarity is 1.

Outcome of the current turn: The defense is trying to establish certain facts about the crime scene handling. The witness's affirmative answer supports the defense's narrative, so the outcome favors the questioner (defense). 

Reason for the outcome: The witness's answer is based on logical and consistent information, which makes the defense's argument more convincing. So, the reason is logical arguments being convincing, which is 1.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether it's desirable for criminalists to arrive at a homicide scene before the coroners. The witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear and direct answer. That seems like a beneficial commitment because it supports the questioner's point, so I'll rate it as 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness's answer seems truthful because it's a general principle that criminalists should arrive before coroners to preserve evidence. So, I'll mark that as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness talked about the importance of protecting the scene and their role in collecting evidence. This answer aligns with those points, so it's consistent. I'll go with 0.

Response relevance: The question is about the desirability of criminalists arriving before coroners, which is very relevant to crime scene procedures. So, relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a simple ""YES,"" very clear without any hedging. Clarity is 1.

Outcome: The questioner gets the benefit here because the witness agreed, so the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The witness's agreement is based on logical arguments about proper crime scene procedures, so reason 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness agreed that arriving before the coroners is desirable. This current answer is consistent with that, so consistency is 0 (consistent).

Response relevance: The answer is very relevant because it directly addresses the importance of evidence preservation, which is central to the case. So relevance is 1.

Reason for the outcome: The witness provided a logical and convincing answer that aligns with the defense's argument, so it's based on logical arguments, reason 1.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness realized Andrea Mazzola couldn't be the officer in charge, and the witness replied, ""I thought it more prudent that I be the officer in charge."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is making a clear statement about their decision, so it's a beneficial commitment because it supports their own position. That would be a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems to be stating their belief honestly, so I'll mark that as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned that Mazzola was a criminalist and handled most of the evidence collection. Now, the witness is taking charge, which seems consistent. So, 0 for consistent.

Relevance: The response directly answers the question about who should be in charge, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

Clarity: The statement is straightforward without hedging, so very clear. That's a 1.

Outcome: The witness's response supports their credibility, so the outcome favors the witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness used a logical argument about prudence, which is convincing. So, reason 1.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was whether the witness knew that one of the victims was Mr. Simpson's ex-wife when they arrived at Rockingham at 7:15. The witness answered ""NO.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a direct ""NO,"" which is a clear and firm answer. That seems like a detrimental commitment because it contradicts the questioner's implication. So, I think it's a 1.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in their previous testimony about not knowing certain details upon arrival. So, I believe they're being truthful here, so that's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: The witness has been consistent in their earlier statements about not recalling specific details, so this is consistent. That's a 0.

Response relevance: The question is about the witness's knowledge upon arrival, which is directly relevant to the case. So, it's very relevant, a 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a straightforward ""NO,"" very clear. So, clarity is a 1.

Outcome of the turn: The witness's clear and firm denial makes their position stronger, so the witness wins this turn.

Reason for the outcome: The witness's logical and clear answer makes their position convincing. So, reason 1.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was whether the witness knew they were at Mr. Simpson's house when they arrived at Rockingham at 7:15. The witness answered, ""I knew that was his residence.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is affirming that they knew it was Simpson's house, which directly answers the question. This seems like a clear commitment, so I think it's a 2, beneficial commitment because it supports the witness's position.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is stating a fact they knew, which seems straightforward. There's no indication they're lying, so I'll mark it as truthful (1).

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned arriving at Rockingham and knowing about the other scene at Bundy. This response is consistent with that, so it's consistent (0).

Relevance: The question is about the witness's knowledge upon arrival, which is very relevant to the case, so relevance is 1.

Clarity: The response is clear and direct without hedging, so clarity is 1.

Outcome: The witness's clear and truthful answer supports their credibility, so the outcome favors the witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness provided a logical and consistent answer, making their position more convincing.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that Andrea Mazzola was primarily responsible for collecting blood samples at the Bundy crime scene and questioned the accuracy of P_Witness's previous statements regarding their involvement in the evidence collection process. They highlighted the importance of proper crime scene management to avoid contamination.
   - **Witness Claim:** P_Witness acknowledged Mazzola's significant role in collecting evidence but insisted that they also participated in the process, albeit to a lesser extent. They maintained that their testimony about the collection methods was accurate, even if they could not recall specific details.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's involvement in collecting blood samples, with the defense asserting she did most of the work while P_Witness conceded she did a good portion but claimed they also assisted.
   - The defense questioned the timeliness of the response to the crime scene, suggesting that the delay in arrival (an hour and forty minutes) could have impacted the integrity of the evidence collected. P_Witness acknowledged the delay but defended the response time as reasonable under the circumstances.
   - The defense also sought to establish that P_Witness should have taken charge of the crime scene, implying that Mazzola's inexperience could have compromised the evidence collection process. P_Witness agreed it was prudent for them to be in charge but did not initially recognize the significance of the victims involved. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to undermine the credibility of the evidence collection process while the witness attempted to affirm their role and the procedures followed.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was whether the witness knew if Detective Vannatter regarded Mr. Simpson as a suspect. The witness answered, ""I don't recall if he relayed that to me or not.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness isn't making a definite statement; they're saying they don't remember. So, they're not committing to either a yes or no. That seems like a neutral commitment, so maybe a 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is being honest about not recalling, so that's truthful. I'll mark that as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned knowing they were at Mr. Simpson's house but didn't know about the victims. This response doesn't contradict that, so it's consistent. That's 0.

Relevance: The question is about whether the detective saw Simpson as a suspect, which is relevant to the case, so very relevant. That's a 1.

Clarity: The response is clear but uses hedging with ""I don't recall,"" so slightly clear with hedging. That's a 2.

Outcome: The questioner is trying to establish if the witness knew Simpson was a suspect. Since the witness doesn't recall, the questioner doesn't gain the information they wanted. So, the witness wins this turn.

Reason for outcome: The witness's lack of recall doesn't provide the questioner with the needed information, so it's a credibility issue. That's reason 2.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness observed red blood drops at Rockingham, and the witness simply answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES"" without any hesitation or hedging. That seems like a strong commitment, so I'd rate it as a 1, which is detrimental to the questioner because it's a clear affirmation.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in acknowledging the presence of blood drops, so I think this is truthful. Therefore, it's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness talked about collecting blood drops, so this ""YES"" aligns with that. It's consistent, so a 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the presence of blood drops, which is very relevant to the case. So, relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a simple ""YES,"" very clear without any ambiguity. Clarity is 1.

Outcome: The questioner gets a clear answer that supports their line of questioning, so the outcome favors the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The answer is a direct affirmation, which is a logical and convincing point for the questioner. So, reason is 1.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that Andrea Mazzola was primarily responsible for collecting blood samples at the Bundy crime scene and questioned the accuracy of P_Witness's previous statements regarding their involvement in the evidence collection process.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about the time the witness arrived at the Bundy crime scene, and the response given was, ""I arrived there at 10:15 in the morning."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness provided a specific time, which is a clear and direct answer. This seems like a beneficial commitment because it gives precise information that the questioner can use. So, I think the commitment level is 2.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness stated a specific time without any hesitation or ambiguity. There's no indication that this is false, so I consider this truthful, which is a 1.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, earlier in the transcript, the witness mentioned arriving at Rockingham at 7:10 and that the response time was an hour and forty minutes. If the time at Bundy is 10:15, that would be about three hours after the initial call, which seems consistent with the timeline. So, consistency is 0.

The response is very relevant because it directly answers the question about the arrival time, so relevance is 1.

Clarity-wise, the response is very clear. The witness provided an exact time without any hedging, so clarity is 1.

As for the outcome, the questioner asked for the arrival time, and the witness provided it clearly. This helps the questioner's case, so the outcome favors the questioner.

The reason for this outcome is that the witness provided a logical and precise answer, which supports the questioner's line of inquiry. So, the reason is 1.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the victims at Bundy were discovered in the early morning hours, and the witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear affirmation. That seems like a high commitment because it's a direct answer without any hedging. So, I think the commitment level is 1, which is detrimental because it benefits the questioner by confirming their point.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in previous testimony about the timeline, so this ""YES"" aligns with what was said before. There's no indication of lying here, so I'll mark it as truthful, which is 1.

Consistency with previous testimony is also important. Earlier, the witness mentioned arriving at Bundy at 10:15 AM and that the bodies were discovered earlier. This answer is consistent with that, so consistency is 0, meaning it's consistent.

Relevance of the response is very high because it directly answers the question about the discovery time, which is crucial for the case timeline. So, relevance is 1.

Clarity of the response is very clear because it's a simple ""YES"" without any ambiguity. So, clarity is 1.

The outcome of this turn is that the questioner benefits because the witness confirmed the fact, which helps the questioner's case. So, the outcome is ""Questioner.""

The reason for this outcome is that the witness's answer supports the questioner's line of questioning, likely building a timeline that could be relevant to their case. So, the reason is logical arguments being convincing, which is 1.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about the time elapsed between when the bodies were found and when the witness arrived at the Bundy crime scene. The witness answered, ""Something like that."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness isn't making a strong statement here; they're being vague. So, it's a 4 because they're not committing to a specific time frame.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is being non-specific, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're lying. They might just not remember exactly. So, I'll say 1 for truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned arriving at 10:15 AM and that the bodies were found in the early morning. This response is consistent with that, so it's a 0.

Response relevance: The question is about the time elapsed, which is relevant to the case, especially regarding evidence handling. So, it's very relevant, a 1.

Response clarity: The answer is vague and not precise, so it's slightly unclear. That's a 3.

Outcome: The questioner is trying to establish a timeline, and the witness's vague answer doesn't help the questioner. So, the witness wins this turn.

Reason for outcome: The witness's lack of clarity doesn't provide the questioner with useful information, so it's more of a credibility issue, which is reason 2.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether there was a blanket over Nicole Brown Simpson's body when the witness arrived at the Bundy crime scene. The witness answered, ""I don't recall being there that soon. When I got there, the body of Miss Simpson was being processed.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness seems to be avoiding a direct answer by saying they don't recall, which could be seen as not committing to either a yes or no. So, I think the commitment level is 4, no commitment made.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is stating their lack of recall, which is a common way to avoid answering directly. However, they also provide some information about the body being processed, which might be truthful. I'm leaning towards 1, truthful, because they're not necessarily lying, just not providing a clear answer.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned arriving at Bundy at 10:15 AM and that the bodies were discovered early in the morning. If the body was being processed upon arrival, it's consistent with the timeline. So, consistency is 0, consistent.

Response relevance: The question is about the presence of a blanket, which is relevant to the crime scene. The witness's answer doesn't directly address the blanket but talks about the body being processed, which is somewhat relevant. I'd rate it 2, slightly relevant.

Clarity: The response is a bit unclear because the witness doesn't directly answer whether they saw the blanket. They hedge by saying they don't recall and then provide another detail. So, clarity is 3, slightly unclear.

Outcome: The questioner might not get the information they wanted, so the witness might be seen as avoiding the question. Therefore, the outcome could favor the witness because they didn't provide a direct answer that could be used against them.

Reason for outcome: The witness used a credibility attack by not recalling and providing an alternative fact, which might make the questioner's point less effective. So, reason 2, credibility attack on the other side.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness saw a blanket over Nicole Brown Simpson's body at the Bundy crime scene. The witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear and direct answer. That seems like a high commitment, so I'd rate it as a 1, which is detrimental commitment because it benefits the questioner.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in their previous testimony about the crime scene, so I think this answer is truthful. I'll mark that as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned arriving at Bundy and seeing the body being processed. This ""YES"" about the blanket aligns with that, so it's consistent. That's a 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the crime scene and evidence, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a simple ""YES,"" very clear without any hedging. So clarity is a 1.

Outcome of the turn: The questioner gets a clear affirmative answer, which helps their case, so the outcome favors the Questioner.

Reason for the outcome: The answer is based on a logical and clear response, so reason 1 applies.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness learned that a blanket was used to cover Nicole Brown Simpson's body during their investigation that day. The witness answered ""YES.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES"" without any hesitation or hedging. That seems like a clear commitment, so I'd rate it as a 1, which is detrimental commitment because it benefits the questioner by affirming their point.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in their previous testimony about the crime scene, so I don't see any immediate red flags here. They're confirming a fact they learned, which seems truthful, so I'll mark that as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned arriving at Bundy and seeing the body being processed. Now, they're confirming the use of a blanket, which aligns with what they might have observed or been told. So, consistent, which is 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the blanket, which is a specific detail related to the crime scene. It's very relevant to the case, so I'll rate it as 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a simple ""YES,"" very clear without any ambiguity. That's a 1.

Outcome of the current turn: The questioner gets a clear affirmation, which helps their case, so the outcome favors the Questioner.

Reason for the outcome: The witness provided a logical and consistent answer, which supports the questioner's line of inquiry. So, reason 1, logical arguments are convincing.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness learned that the blanket used to cover Nicole Brown Simpson's body came from her home. The witness answered, ""SINCE THEN, YES.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is agreeing with the statement, so that's a commitment. Since it's a yes, it benefits the questioner, so I think it's a detrimental commitment, which is level 1.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems to be providing a direct answer without hesitation, so I'll mark that as truthful, which is 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned that the blanket was used to cover the body, and now they're confirming it came from her home. That seems consistent, so I'll say consistent, which is 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the origin of the blanket, which is very relevant to the case, so relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The answer is straightforward and clear, so clarity is 1.

Outcome of the turn: The questioner gets the information they wanted, so the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

Reason for the outcome: The witness provided a clear and truthful answer that supports the questioner's line of inquiry, so it's based on logical arguments.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response to the defense's question in this cross-examination. The question was about whether a blanket used to cover Nicole Brown Simpson's body could transfer O.J. Simpson's hairs to the crime scene. The witness answered, ""IT'S POSSIBLE.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness says it's possible, which is a neutral statement. They're not fully committing to it being a definite source but acknowledging that it could happen. So, I think this is a neutral commitment, which would be a 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is a criminalist, so they should know about evidence transfer. Their answer seems honest because secondary transfer is a known concept in forensic science. So, I'll rate this as truthful, a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness talked about how Andrea Mazzola handled evidence and the procedures followed. This question is about the possibility of hair transfer, which hasn't been directly contradicted in previous testimony. So, it's consistent, a 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the case and the possibility of evidence contamination, which is very relevant. So, relevance is a 1.

Response clarity: The answer is straightforward and clear, without hedging. So, clarity is a 1.

Outcome of the turn: The defense is suggesting that the hairs could have been transferred via the blanket, which supports their case. The witness's agreement makes the defense's point more convincing. So, the outcome favors the questioner (defense), and the reason is that the logical argument is convincing.

Putting it all together, the witness's response helps the defense by acknowledging the possibility, which supports their theory of secondary transfer. The answer is truthful, relevant, and clear, so the defense gains an advantage here.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response to the defense attorney's question about whether using the blanket from Nicole Brown Simpson's house at the crime scene was a mistake due to cross-contamination risks. The witness answered, ""DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is hedging by saying it depends on the blanket's cleanliness, which doesn't give a clear yes or no. This seems like a neutral commitment because they're not firmly agreeing or disagreeing. So, I think it's a 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is providing a conditional answer based on a factor (cleanliness) that could indeed affect contamination. This seems truthful because they're considering a relevant variable. So, I'll rate it as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness acknowledged the possibility of secondary transfer, which aligns with this answer. They didn't contradict themselves, so it's consistent. That's a 0.

Response relevance: The answer directly addresses the question about contamination risks, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

Response clarity: The witness uses a hedge (""depending on"") and repeats themselves, which makes the answer slightly unclear. So, I'll go with 2.

Outcome of the turn: The defense is trying to show that the police made a mistake. The witness's conditional answer doesn't fully support the defense's point, so the witness maintains some ground. Therefore, the outcome favors the witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness's answer is based on a logical argument about the blanket's cleanliness, which is a valid point. So, the reason is logical arguments, which is 1.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether Nicole Brown Simpson's body was in the area of the blanket at the crime scene, and the witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear and direct answer. That seems like a high commitment because it's a definitive response without any hedging. So, I think the commitment level is 1, which is detrimental to the questioner because it clearly supports the defense's point.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness has been consistent in previous testimony about the blanket and the body's location. There's no indication here that the witness is being untruthful, so I'll rate that as 1 for truthful.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, the witness has mentioned the blanket and the body's location before, so this answer aligns with that. Therefore, consistency is 0, meaning it's consistent.

The response is very relevant to the question asked. The defense is trying to establish the placement of the body and the potential for contamination, so the answer directly addresses that. Relevance is 1.

Clarity-wise, the answer is very clear. A simple ""YES"" without any ambiguity, so clarity is 1.

As for the outcome, the witness's clear and direct answer supports the defense's line of questioning, making the defense the winner of this turn. The reason is that the logical argument presented by the defense is convincing because the witness's testimony backs it up.

So, putting it all together, the witness's response is clear, consistent, and truthful, which helps the defense's case.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether Mr. Goldman's body was eventually placed in the area of the blanket. The witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear and direct answer. That seems like a high commitment because it's a definitive response without any hedging. So, I think the commitment level is 1, which is detrimental to the witness because it clearly benefits the questioner.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness has been consistent in their previous testimony about the placement of the bodies and the blanket. There's no indication here that the witness is being untruthful. So, I'll rate truthfulness as 1.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, the witness has mentioned the blanket and its origin before. This answer aligns with what was said earlier, so consistency is 0, meaning it's consistent.

The response is very relevant to the line of questioning about the crime scene and potential contamination. It directly addresses the question, so relevance is 1.

Clarity-wise, the answer is very clear. A simple ""YES"" leaves no room for ambiguity, so clarity is 1.

As for the outcome of this turn, the questioner seems to be making a point about contamination, and the witness's affirmative answer supports that. So, the questioner benefits here, making the outcome in favor of the questioner.

The reason for this outcome is the logical argument presented by the questioner. The witness's clear and consistent answer helps build the case for potential contamination, which is a logical point. So, the reason is 1.

Putting it all together, the witness's clear and consistent answer supports the questioner's line of argument, making the questioner the winner of this turn.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the blanket could be a source of contamination for Mr. Goldman's clothing. The witness answered that the coroner's personnel placed a sheet and a plastic sheet over the blanket before putting Mr. Goldman on it. 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is providing specific details about the placement of the sheet and plastic, which seems to support their position. So, this is a beneficial commitment for the witness, which would be a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is stating facts about the coroner's actions, which seems truthful based on their knowledge, so I'll rate that as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned the blanket was used to cover the body, and now they're adding details about sheets and plastic. This seems consistent, so 0.

Response relevance: The answer directly addresses the question about contamination, so it's very relevant, which is 1.

Clarity: The response is clear and specific, so very clear, which is 1.

Outcome: The witness provided a clear, truthful answer that supports their position, so the outcome favors the witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness used logical arguments by explaining the protective layers, which makes their point convincing.

GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the blanket could have contaminated evidence, specifically hairs and fibers, when it was moved and placed near the victims' bodies. The witness answered ""Possibly.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness says ""Possibly,"" which is a bit hedged. They're not fully committing to a definite yes or no, so it's a neutral commitment. That would be a 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is acknowledging the possibility without outright denying it, which seems truthful. So, I'll mark that as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness discussed contamination risks and the procedures followed. This answer aligns with that, so it's consistent. That's a 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about contamination, which is central to the case. So, it's very relevant, a 1.

Clarity: ""Possibly"" is clear but somewhat hedged, so slightly clear with hedging. That's a 2.

Outcome: The questioner is trying to show contamination, and the witness's answer supports that possibility. So, the questioner benefits here.

Reason for outcome: The witness's answer is based on logical arguments about contamination, so reason 1.

P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the blanket could have fibers consistent with Mr. Simpson's Bronco, and the witness answered, ""Possibly, yes."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness says ""possibly,"" which is a bit hedged. It's not a definite yes or no, so it's a neutral commitment. That would be a 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is acknowledging the possibility, which seems honest given the circumstances. So I'd rate that as 1, truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness agreed that contamination was possible, so this is consistent. Therefore, it's a 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the fibers on the blanket, which is very relevant to the case. So relevance is 1.

Clarity: The answer is clear but uses ""possibly,"" which is a hedge. So it's slightly clear with hedging, which is a 2.

Outcome: The questioner is trying to establish that contamination could have happened, and the witness agreed. So the questioner benefits here, making the outcome ""Questioner.""

Reason for outcome: The witness's answer supports the questioner's point about possible contamination, so it's based on logical arguments. That's reason 1.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?

P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the blanket was left at the crime scene and never picked up for analysis, and the witness answered, ""THAT'S CORRECT."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is agreeing with the statement, which seems to support the defense's point. So, this is a detrimental commitment because it benefits the questioner (the defense). That would be a 1.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is confirming a fact, so it seems truthful. I'll mark that as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness discussed the blanket being used and the potential for contamination. This answer is consistent with that, so it's a 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the blanket and its handling, which is very relevant to the case. So, relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The answer is straightforward and clear, so clarity is 1.

Outcome: The questioner (defense) benefits because the witness confirmed the blanket wasn't analyzed, which could imply possible contamination. So, the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The defense is using this to attack the credibility of the evidence handling, which is a credibility attack. So, reason 2.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response to the defense attorney's question. The question was about whether leaving the blanket at the crime scene was a mistake. The witness answered, ""IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is somewhat agreeing that it was a mistake but doesn't fully commit. They're hedging by saying ""could be considered,"" which isn't a strong commitment. So I think this is a detrimental commitment because it benefits the questioner (the defense) by acknowledging a potential mistake.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems honest here because they're admitting that leaving the blanket could be seen as an error, which aligns with their expertise in crime scene contamination. So I'll mark this as truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness discussed the importance of avoiding contamination and the procedures followed. This response is consistent because it aligns with the principles they mentioned before. So it's consistent.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the blanket and contamination, which is very relevant to the case. So high relevance.

Response clarity: The answer is clear but uses ""could be considered,"" which is a bit hedged. So it's slightly clear with some hedging.

Outcome: The defense benefits because the witness agreed it could be a mistake, so the questioner wins this turn.

Reason for outcome: The defense used a credibility attack by pointing out a potential mistake in evidence handling, which undermines the prosecution's case.

   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged the principles of crime scene protection and confirmed that Mazzola collected most of the blood samples, but also indicated that he participated in the collection process, albeit to a lesser extent.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's training and her role in the evidence collection process. The defense suggested that Mazzola was still in training during the incident, while the witness maintained she was a criminalist.
   - The defense questioned the witness's recollection of events and the accuracy of his previous testimonies, particularly regarding who swatched the blood drops and the timeline of their arrival at the crime scenes.
   - The defense raised concerns about the potential contamination of evidence, particularly regarding a blanket that was moved into the crime scene, suggesting that it could have introduced secondary transfer of hairs and fibers, which the witness acknowledged as a possibility but did not definitively confirm as a mistake. 

Overall, the defense aimed to undermine the credibility of the evidence collection process, while the witness defended the procedures followed, albeit with some admissions of potential errors.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness had concerns regarding cross-contamination when Detective Lange requested bringing the glove into the middle of the Bundy crime scene. The witness answered, ""I knew there was a danger for cross-contamination, yes.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is agreeing that there was a danger, which directly answers the question. This seems like a clear commitment, so I think it's a 1, detrimental commitment because it benefits the questioner (the defense) by highlighting a potential issue in evidence handling.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is stating their knowledge of the danger, which seems straightforward and honest. There's no indication of evasion or dishonesty, so I'll rate this as 1, truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony. Earlier, the witness discussed the importance of protecting the crime scene and the potential for contamination, especially regarding the blanket. This response aligns with those previous statements, so it's consistent. Therefore, consistency is 0.

Response relevance. The question is directly about cross-contamination concerns, and the answer is very relevant to that. So relevance is 1.

Response clarity. The answer is clear and direct without hedging, so clarity is 1.

Outcome of the current turn. The witness's admission benefits the defense by pointing out a flaw in evidence handling, so the questioner (defense) wins this turn.

Reason for the outcome. The witness's admission logically supports the defense's argument about contamination, so it's based on logical arguments. Therefore, reason is 1.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether trace evidence can become airborne, and the witness simply answered ""Sometimes."" 

First, looking at commitment level. The witness gave a short answer without elaborating, so it's a bit neutral. They didn't strongly agree or disagree, just acknowledged the possibility. That seems like a neutral commitment, so I'll go with 3.

Next, truthfulness. The answer seems honest because trace evidence can indeed become airborne under certain conditions, like if it's light or in a windy environment. So, the witness is being truthful here, which is a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony. Earlier, the witness discussed contamination and the importance of protecting the scene, which relates to how evidence might spread. The current answer about airborne trace evidence aligns with that, so it's consistent. That's a 0.

Response relevance. The question is about trace evidence becoming airborne, which is directly related to the topic of contamination and evidence handling. So, it's very relevant, which is a 1.

Response clarity. The answer is straightforward and clear, just ""Sometimes."" There's no hedging or ambiguity, so clarity is very clear, a 1.

Outcome of the turn. The questioner is trying to establish that contamination could have happened through airborne evidence. The witness's affirmative answer supports the questioner's point, so the questioner wins this turn.

Reason for the outcome. The witness's answer is based on a logical argument about how trace evidence behaves, which makes the questioner's point convincing. So, the reason is logical arguments, which is 1.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether hairs and fibers can become airborne and transfer, which is how the transfer occurs. The witness answered, ""THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness says ""theoretically yes,"" which seems a bit hedged. They're not fully committing but acknowledging the possibility. So I think this is a neutral commitment, maybe a 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is explaining the process accurately, mentioning both contact and airborne transfer. This seems truthful, so I'll rate it as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness discussed contamination and the importance of protecting the scene. This answer aligns with that, so it's consistent, rating 0.

Response relevance: The question is about how trace evidence transfers, which is very relevant to the case, especially regarding contamination. So relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The witness uses ""theoretically"" and explains both methods, which is clear but has a slight hedge. I'd say slightly clear with hedging, so 2.

Outcome: The questioner is trying to establish that contamination could have happened through airborne transfer. The witness agrees it's possible, which helps the questioner's point. So the outcome favors the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The witness provided a logical argument that supports the possibility of contamination, which is a convincing point for the defense. So reason 1.

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response to the question about when they began collecting blood drops at Bundy. The witness answered, ""Approximately eleven o'clock, 11:30, around there."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is giving a specific time frame but uses ""approximately"" and ""around there,"" which shows some uncertainty. So, it's a bit of a hedge, meaning the commitment isn't detrimental or fully beneficial; it's more neutral. I think this falls under a Neutral commitment, which is level 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is providing a time estimate, which seems honest. They're not being evasive or lying, so I'll mark this as truthful, which is 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned arriving at Bundy around 10:15 AM. If they started collecting blood around 11:30, that seems consistent with the timeline. So, consistency is 0, meaning it's consistent.

Response relevance: The question is about the time they started collecting evidence, which is directly relevant to the case. So, very relevant, which is 1.

Response clarity: The witness uses approximate times with some hedging, so it's slightly clear but not very clear. I'll rate this as 2, slightly clear with hedging.

Outcome of the turn: The questioner is trying to establish a timeline, and the witness provided a time frame, so the questioner gets the information they needed. Therefore, the outcome is in favor of the Questioner.

Reason for the outcome: The witness provided a logical and coherent answer, so it's based on logical arguments. The reason is 1.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper crime scene management to prevent contamination and highlighted that Andrea Mazzola was primarily responsible for collecting blood samples at the Bundy crime scene. They questioned the accuracy of P_Witness's previous statements about Mazzola's training and her role in evidence collection.
   - **Witness Claim:** P_Witness acknowledged Mazzola's significant involvement in collecting evidence but maintained that he also participated in the process. He confirmed that he was present during the collection of blood drops and that he had concerns about contamination.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's experience and her role in collecting evidence. The defense suggested that Mazzola was still in training during the events in question, while P_Witness stated she was a criminalist.
   - The defense questioned the timing of P_Witness's arrival at the crime scene and whether it was appropriate for him to take charge, given the circumstances. P_Witness admitted to arriving later than ideal and acknowledged that he thought it prudent to be the officer in charge after assessing the situation.
   - The defense raised concerns about the potential for contamination due to the handling of evidence, particularly regarding a blanket that could have transferred hairs and fibers. P_Witness agreed that leaving the blanket at the crime scene without analysis could be considered a mistake.
   - The defense also pointed out the risks of cross-contamination when evidence was moved or handled, which P_Witness acknowledged as a valid concern. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant issues regarding evidence collection procedures, the qualifications of the personnel involved, and the potential for contamination that could affect the integrity of the investigation.

P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response to the question about when they began collecting blood drops at Bundy. The witness answered, ""Approximately."" 

First, looking at commitment level. The witness used ""approximately,"" which is a bit vague. They didn't give an exact time, so they're not fully committing to a specific time. This could be seen as a 2 because it's a beneficial commitment for the witness since it doesn't lock them into a precise time that could be disputed.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems to be honest by providing a time frame, even if it's approximate. So I'd rate that as 1, truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony. Earlier, the witness mentioned starting around 11 o'clock or 11:30. This is consistent, so it's a 0, consistent.

Response relevance. The question is about the time they started collecting evidence, which is directly relevant to the case. So relevance is 1, very relevant.

Response clarity. The answer is slightly clear but uses ""approximately,"" which introduces some uncertainty. So clarity is 2, slightly clear with hedging.

Outcome of the turn. The questioner is trying to pin down the exact time, but the witness's vague answer doesn't fully satisfy that. So the witness maintains some control, making the outcome in their favor. So outcome is Witness.

Reason for the outcome. The witness used a non-specific answer, which is a credibility attack on the questioner's attempt to get a precise time. So reason is 2, credibility attack on the other side.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether it was hot inside the truck where they were collecting blood drops. The witness answered, ""THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is providing a specific action they took, which shows they're committed to the statement. It doesn't seem to directly benefit the questioner or themselves, so it's a neutral commitment. I'll go with 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is stating a fact about their actions, which seems straightforward. There's no indication they're lying, so I'll mark it as truthful (1).

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned being present during the collection and taking some actions, but this specific detail about checking the truck's temperature isn't mentioned before. So, it's consistent in the sense that it doesn't contradict anything, but it's a new detail. I think it's consistent, so 0.

Relevance: The question is about the conditions during evidence collection, which is relevant to the case. It's very relevant because it pertains to potential contamination issues. So, relevance rate is 1.

Clarity: The response is clear and direct without hedging. Manner rate is 1.

Outcome: The witness provided a clear, relevant answer that supports their credibility. So, the outcome favors the witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness's response is logical and clear, making their argument convincing. So, reason 1.

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether they began taking the wet blood stains out of the plastic bags around 6:30 in the evening, and the witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear affirmation. This seems to be a detrimental commitment because it directly supports the questioner's (defense) line of inquiry, potentially indicating a problem in their procedures. So, I'd rate the commitment level as 1.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness has been consistent in their previous testimony about the timeline of evidence collection. They mentioned starting around 11:30 and not beginning to remove the stains until later. Since there's no indication they're lying here, I'll mark this as truthful (1).

Looking at consistency, the witness's answer aligns with earlier statements about the timing of their evidence handling. There's no inconsistency noted, so this is consistent (0).

The response is very relevant because it pertains directly to the handling of evidence, which is crucial for assessing potential contamination or mishandling. So, relevance is 1.

Clarity-wise, the answer is very clear. A simple ""YES"" without any hedging or ambiguity. Therefore, clarity is 1.

The outcome of this turn favors the questioner (defense) because the admission supports their argument about possible contamination or improper handling of evidence. The reason for this outcome is the logical argument presented by the defense, which the witness's answer supports.

So, putting it all together, the witness's response is clear, consistent, and truthful, but it benefits the defense by highlighting a potential issue in evidence handling.

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The witness answered ""YES"" to the question about whether the time frame was around seven hours. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear affirmation. This directly benefits the questioner because it confirms the point they were making. So, I'd rate the commitment level as 1, detrimental to the witness, beneficial to the questioner.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in their previous testimony about the timeline of collecting evidence. They mentioned starting around 11:30 and not beginning to take the bloodstains out until 6:30, which is roughly seven hours. So, this seems truthful, hence a 1 for truthfulness.

Consistency with previous testimony is also important. Earlier, the witness provided specific times and the process they followed. This ""YES"" aligns with that, so it's consistent. Therefore, consistency is 0, meaning it's consistent.

Relevance of the response is very high because it directly addresses the question about the time frame, which is crucial for understanding potential contamination issues. So, relevance is 1.

Clarity of the response is very clear. A simple ""YES"" without any hedging or ambiguity makes it easy to understand. Thus, clarity is 1.

The outcome of this turn favors the questioner because the witness's confirmation supports the defense's line of questioning about possible contamination due to the time evidence was left in the truck. So, the outcome is the questioner winning this part.

The reason for this outcome is the logical argument presented by the questioner. They highlighted the time frame, which could imply that the evidence was left for too long, potentially leading to contamination. This is a logical argument that the witness's answer supports, so the reason is 1.

Putting it all together, the witness's response effectively supports the defense's argument, making the questioner the winner of this exchange.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper crime scene management and questioned the witness's reliability regarding the collection of blood evidence, particularly focusing on the role of Andrea Mazzola in swatching blood drops and the potential for contamination due to procedural errors.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged the principles of crime scene protection and confirmed that Mazzola collected most of the blood samples, but also indicated that he participated in the collection process, albeit to a lesser extent.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the accuracy of the witness's previous testimony regarding Mazzola's training status and the extent of her involvement in collecting blood samples. The defense suggested inconsistencies in the witness's statements about who swatched the blood drops and the timing of their arrival at the crime scenes.
   - The defense raised concerns about the potential for contamination due to the handling of evidence, particularly regarding a blanket that was placed at the crime scene, which could have introduced trace evidence from other sources. The witness acknowledged the possibility of contamination but did not fully concede that the handling of the blanket was a mistake.
   - The defense also highlighted the delay in processing the blood samples, questioning the witness about the implications of leaving wet blood stains in plastic bags for an extended period, which could affect the integrity of the evidence. The witness confirmed the timeline but did not directly address the potential consequences of this delay. 

Overall, the defense aimed to undermine the credibility of the evidence collection process, while the witness attempted to affirm the procedures followed, albeit with some acknowledgment of potential issues.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether there's a refrigerator in the crime scene processing truck, and the witness answered, ""THERE IS ONE, YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""yes"" without any hesitation or ambiguity. That seems like a clear commitment, so I'd rate it as a 1, which is detrimental commitment because it benefits the questioner by confirming a fact that might be important for their case.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness's answer is direct and doesn't show any signs of evasion or deception. So, I think the witness is being truthful here, which means a truthfulness score of 1.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, the witness hasn't mentioned the refrigerator before in the provided transcript. Since there's no prior mention, I can't say it's inconsistent. Therefore, consistency is 0, meaning it's consistent or there's no prior info to compare.

The response is very relevant because the question is about the processing of evidence, specifically how blood samples were handled. Knowing if there's a refrigerator affects the integrity of the evidence, so relevance is a 1.

Clarity-wise, the answer is very clear. It's a simple ""yes"" without any hedging or uncertainty, so clarity is a 1.

As for the outcome of this turn, the questioner gets the information they wanted, which could be useful for their argument about evidence handling. So, the outcome favors the questioner.

The reason for this outcome is that the witness provided a clear and direct answer, which supports the questioner's line of inquiry. There's no emotional appeal or credibility attack here; it's just a factual confirmation. So, the reason is logical arguments being convincing.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper crime scene management and questioned the witness's reliability regarding the collection of blood evidence, particularly focusing on the role of Andrea Mazzola in swatching blood drops and the potential for contamination due to procedural errors.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged the principles of crime scene protection and confirmed that Mazzola collected a significant portion of the blood evidence, but also stated that he assisted in the collection process, albeit not recalling specific instances.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's involvement in collecting blood evidence, with the defense suggesting she was primarily responsible while the witness conceded she did most but not all of the work.
   - The defense questioned the witness's response time to the crime scene and the implications of arriving after the coroner, suggesting it could compromise evidence integrity. The witness agreed that it is generally desirable for criminalists to arrive before the coroner but did not recall specific details about the timing of events.
   - The defense raised concerns about the potential for cross-contamination of evidence, particularly regarding a blanket that was placed at the crime scene, and the witness acknowledged that this could be a source of contamination but did not definitively label it a mistake.
   - The defense also highlighted the delay in processing blood evidence, questioning the witness about the conditions under which the evidence was stored, which could affect its integrity. The witness confirmed the presence of a refrigerator in the processing truck but did not provide a clear justification for the delay in processing the blood samples. 

Overall, the conversation revealed significant tension between the defense's assertions about evidence handling and the witness's responses, indicating potential weaknesses in the prosecution's case regarding the integrity of the evidence collected.

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether there's a refrigerator in the crime scene processing truck and if it was used. The witness answered, ""NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is giving a reason why the refrigerator wasn't used, which seems to commit to the fact that the fridge wasn't functional. So, this is a detrimental commitment because it benefits the questioner by explaining why the evidence might have been compromised. So, I think the commitment level is 1.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is providing a specific reason, so it seems truthful. They're not evading or lying here. So, I'll rate truthfulness as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned that they went out to the truck to make sure it wasn't getting too hot, implying they were monitoring the temperature. Now, they're saying the fridge stopped working. This seems consistent because if the fridge wasn't working, they'd have to check the temperature manually. So, consistency is 0.

Response relevance: The question is about the handling of evidence, specifically bloodstains, and whether the fridge was used. The witness's answer directly addresses this, so it's very relevant. Relevance rate is 1.

Response clarity: The witness's explanation is clear. They explain that the fridge doesn't keep working, which is a straightforward reason. So, clarity is 1.

Outcome of the current turn: The questioner is trying to show that evidence handling was improper. The witness's answer supports that by indicating the fridge wasn't used because it stopped working, which could affect evidence integrity. So, the questioner benefits here, making the outcome in favor of the questioner.

Reason for the outcome: The witness provided a logical argument about the fridge's functionality, which supports the questioner's line of inquiry. So, the reason is logical arguments being convincing, which is 1.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: SO IT'S YOUR TESTIMONY OR IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY THAT ON JULY 6TH, YOU WENT AT THE REQUEST OF MISS CLARK AND YOU LOOKED FOR BLOODSTAINS ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE BRONCO DOOR?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether on July 6th, the witness went to look for bloodstains on the exterior of the Bronco door at the request of Miss Clark. The witness answered, ""THE EXTERIOR OF THE BRONCO DOOR BY THE DOOR SILL, YES.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a direct ""yes"" and specified the location, which shows a clear commitment. This seems to benefit the questioner because it's a straightforward affirmation without hesitation. So, I think the commitment level is 1 (detrimental commitment).

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness's answer is concise and specific. There's no indication of evasion or deception, so I consider this truthful, which is a 1.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, the witness has been providing detailed answers about their actions and the collection process. This response aligns with that pattern, so it's consistent, which is a 0.

The response is very relevant to the question asked. It directly addresses the query about the specific action on July 6th, so relevance is 1.

Clarity-wise, the answer is very clear. The witness not only affirmed the action but also specified the location, making it straightforward. So, clarity is 1.

As for the outcome, the questioner gets the information they were seeking without ambiguity, so the outcome favors the questioner.

The reason for this outcome is the logical and clear response from the witness, which supports the questioner's line of inquiry. Therefore, the reason is 1 (logical arguments are convincing).

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper crime scene management and questioned the witness's reliability regarding the collection of blood evidence, particularly focusing on the role of Andrea Mazzola in swatching blood drops and the potential for contamination due to procedural errors.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged the principles of crime scene protection and confirmed that Mazzola collected most of the blood samples, but also indicated that he participated in the collection process. He maintained that he performed some functions accurately, although he could not recall specifics.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's training and her role in the evidence collection process. The defense suggested that Mazzola was still in training during the incident, while the witness insisted she was a criminalist.
   - The defense questioned the witness about the timing of his arrival at the crime scenes and the implications of delayed evidence processing, particularly regarding the blood samples collected and the potential for contamination due to improper handling and storage.
   - The witness acknowledged the possibility of contamination from a blanket that was improperly placed at the crime scene, which the defense argued was a significant oversight that could affect the integrity of the evidence collected. The witness conceded that this could be considered a mistake.
   - The defense also highlighted the importance of arriving at the crime scene before the coroner to preserve evidence, suggesting that the witness's delayed response could have compromised the investigation. The witness agreed that it is generally desirable for criminalists to arrive first but did not recall specific details about the case's urgency. 

Overall, the defense aimed to undermine the credibility of the evidence collection process, while the witness defended the actions taken during the investigation, albeit with some admissions of potential errors.

P_WITNESS: THE EXTERIOR OF THE BRONCO DOOR BY THE DOOR SILL, YES.

DEFENSE: DID YOU CONDUCT A PRESUMPTIVE PHENOLPHTHALEIN TEST AND YOU GOT A POSITIVE RESULT?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness conducted a presumptive phenolphthalein test on the exterior of the Bronco door and got a positive result. The witness answered ""YES.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear and direct answer. This seems like a high commitment because it's a definitive response without any hedging. So, I think this is a beneficial commitment for the questioner because it directly supports the line of questioning.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness has been consistent in their previous testimony about conducting tests and collecting evidence. There's no indication here that the witness is being untruthful, so I'll mark this as truthful.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, the witness has talked about collecting bloodstains and conducting tests, so this ""YES"" aligns with that. Therefore, it's consistent.

The response is very relevant because it directly answers the question about the test and the result, which is crucial for the case.

Clarity-wise, the answer is very clear. A simple ""YES"" without any ambiguity.

As for the outcome, the questioner benefits because the answer supports their case. The reason is that the witness provided a clear, truthful, and consistent answer that's directly relevant to the question. There's no emotional appeal or credibility attack here; it's based on the logical and consistent response from the witness.

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: THE EXTERIOR OF THE BRONCO DOOR BY THE DOOR SILL, YES.

DEFENSE: DID YOU CONDUCT A PRESUMPTIVE PHENOLPHTHALEIN TEST AND YOU GOT A POSITIVE RESULT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU NEVER SAW ANY RED STAINS ON THE BOTTOM OF THAT BRONCO DOOR ON JULY 6TH?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was whether the witness saw any red stains on the bottom of the Bronco door on July 6th. The witness answered, ""NO. I DID SEE A STAIN THAT GAVE A POSITIVE FOR THE PRESENCE OF BLOOD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR SILL THERE.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is making a clear statement, so it's a beneficial commitment because it supports their own position. That would be a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems to be providing a direct answer without hesitation, so I'd rate that as truthful, which is 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned conducting a phenolphthalein test and getting a positive result, which aligns with this statement. So, it's consistent, which is 0.

Response relevance: The answer directly addresses the question about the stain, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

Response clarity: The witness is clear and specific about seeing the stain and the test result, so very clear, which is 1.

Outcome: The witness's clear and consistent answer supports their credibility, so the outcome favors the witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness provided logical arguments with specific details, making their answer convincing. So, reason 1.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: SO IT'S YOUR TESTIMONY OR IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY THAT ON JULY 6TH, YOU WENT AT THE REQUEST OF MISS CLARK AND YOU LOOKED FOR BLOODSTAINS ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE BRONCO DOOR?
P_WITNESS: THE EXTERIOR OF THE BRONCO DOOR BY THE DOOR SILL, YES.

DEFENSE: DID YOU CONDUCT A PRESUMPTIVE PHENOLPHTHALEIN TEST AND YOU GOT A POSITIVE RESULT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU NEVER SAW ANY RED STAINS ON THE BOTTOM OF THAT BRONCO DOOR ON JULY 6TH?
P_WITNESS: NO. I DID SEE A STAIN THAT GAVE A POSITIVE FOR THE PRESENCE OF BLOOD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR SILL THERE.

DEFENSE: ISN'T IT TRUE, MR. FUNG, THAT YOU NEVER REMOVED ANYTHING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THAT BRONCO DOOR ON JULY 6TH FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING A PRESUMPTIVE TEST?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question is about whether Mr. Fung saw any red stains on the bottom of the Bronco door on July 6th and whether he removed anything for testing. The witness responds by saying he performed a presumptive test on a dark stain at the door sill of the driver door.

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is making a specific statement about performing a test, which seems to commit him to that action. However, he doesn't explicitly say he saw red stains or removed something, so it's a bit neutral. I think it's a neutral commitment because he's providing information but not directly answering the yes/no part of the question.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems to be stating facts about the test he performed, so I would rate this as truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, he mentioned collecting blood drops and using presumptive tests, so this seems consistent. Therefore, consistent.

Response relevance: The answer is directly addressing the question about the test, so it's very relevant.

Clarity: The response is clear and specific about the action taken, so very clear.

Outcome: The witness is providing a clear answer that supports his previous statements, so the witness wins this turn.

Reason for outcome: The witness used logical arguments by specifying the test he performed, which makes his response convincing.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that the integrity of the crime scene was compromised due to the actions of the criminalists, particularly focusing on the collection of blood evidence and the potential for contamination. They highlighted that Andrea Mazzola was primarily responsible for collecting blood samples and questioned the accuracy of the witness's previous statements regarding her training and the collection process.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged that Mazzola collected a significant portion of the blood samples but insisted that he also participated in the collection process. He maintained that he followed proper procedures and that any discrepancies in his previous testimony were not intentional.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness removed some of the stain from the bottom of the Bronco door on July 6th for testing. The witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a direct ""YES,"" which is a clear and firm answer. This seems to be a beneficial commitment because it directly addresses the question without hedging, so I'll rate it as a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in their previous testimony about performing a presumptive test on the stain. Since they've mentioned this before, it seems truthful, so I'll mark it as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness talked about conducting a test and seeing a positive result, which aligns with this answer. Therefore, it's consistent, so 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the actions taken on July 6th, which is central to the case. The answer is very relevant, so I'll give it a 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a straightforward ""YES"" without any ambiguity, making it very clear. So, clarity is 1.

Outcome of the turn: The questioner asked a specific question and got a direct affirmative answer, which helps their case. So, the questioner wins this turn.

Reason for the outcome: The witness's answer supports the questioner's line of inquiry, providing a logical and clear confirmation. So, the reason is logical arguments being convincing, which is 1.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was whether Mr. Fung went to look at the Bronco on July 6th simply to refresh his memory for court. The witness replied, ""I went there specifically to look at the driver door sill and perform a presumptive test on it.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is clearly stating his purpose, so he's making a commitment. But does this commitment benefit the questioner or the witness? Since he's providing a specific reason, it seems like he's countering the suggestion that he was just there to refresh his memory. So, this might be a beneficial commitment for the witness, which would be a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems to be stating facts about his actions, so I would rate this as truthful, which is a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony. Earlier, he mentioned performing a presumptive test on a stain, which aligns with this response. So, it's consistent, which is a 0.

Response relevance. The answer directly addresses the question about his purpose on July 6th, so it's very relevant, a 1.

Response clarity. His answer is straightforward without hedging, so very clear, a 1.

Outcome of the current turn. The witness provided a clear, specific reason, which supports his credibility, so the witness wins this turn.

Reason for the outcome. The witness used logical arguments to explain his actions, making his response convincing. So, reason 1.

   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's training and her role in collecting evidence. The defense suggested that Mazzola was still in training during the incident, while the witness claimed she was a criminalist.
   - The defense questioned the witness about the timing of his arrival at the crime scenes and the implications of delayed evidence collection, particularly regarding the blood samples that were left in a hot truck for several hours without proper refrigeration.
   - The witness acknowledged the potential for contamination from a blanket that was improperly placed at the crime scene, which the defense argued could have affected the integrity of the evidence collected.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's recollection of specific actions taken during evidence collection, suggesting inconsistencies in his testimony regarding the blood stains on the Bronco and the procedures followed.

Overall, the defense aimed to highlight potential mishandling of evidence and contamination risks, while the witness attempted to defend the procedures followed during the investigation.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: I DID PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON A DARK STAIN AT THE DOOR SILL OF THE DRIVER DOOR.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I WENT THERE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE DRIVER DOOR SILL AND PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON IT.

DEFENSE: DID YOU TELL ANYONE ON AUGUST 8TH THAT YOU VISITED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 6TH TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was whether the witness told anyone on August 8th that he visited the vehicle on July 6th to refresh his memory for court. The witness answered, ""I don't recall saying that.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is saying he doesn't remember, which doesn't commit him to either a yes or no. So, it's a neutral commitment, which would be a 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is being honest about not recalling, so I think he's being truthful here. That's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, he mentioned going on July 6th specifically to perform a test, not just to refresh his memory. So, this seems inconsistent because now he's saying he doesn't recall if he told anyone he went to refresh his memory. That's a 1 for inconsistent.

Relevance: The question is about whether he informed someone about his visit, which is relevant to the case, so I'd say it's very relevant, a 1.

Clarity: His response is straightforward, ""I don't recall,"" so it's very clear. That's a 1.

Outcome: The questioner is trying to find out if the witness's visit was for memory refreshment, which could imply bias. Since the witness doesn't recall, it doesn't help the questioner's case, so the witness wins this turn.

Reason for outcome: The witness's lack of recall doesn't provide the questioner with the information they were seeking, so it's more of a credibility issue, which is reason 2.

DEFENSE: AND IS YOUR TESTIMONY, SIR, WITH RESPECT TO RED STAINS IN THE BRONCO THAT YOU'VE GIVEN TO THIS JURY IN ANY WAY MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO COVER FOR DETECTIVE FUHRMAN?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was whether the witness's testimony about red stains in the Bronco was motivated by a desire to cover for Detective Fuhrman. The witness answered ""NO."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a direct ""NO,"" which is a clear and firm denial. That seems like a beneficial commitment for the witness because it directly opposes the suggestion made by the defense. So, I think the commitment level is 2, beneficial.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in denying any motivation to cover for Fuhrman. There's no obvious indication that this answer is untruthful, so I'll rate it as 1, truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony: The witness has maintained this stance throughout, so it's consistent. Therefore, consistency is 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the witness's motivation, which is central to the case. So, it's very relevant, rating 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a straightforward ""NO"" without any hedging, so clarity is very clear, rating 1.

Outcome: The witness's clear denial supports their position, so the outcome favors the witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness's logical and direct denial without any signs of hesitation or inconsistency makes their response convincing. So, the reason is logical arguments, which is 1.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, YOU'VE TOLD US THAT ON THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 13TH AT ROCKINGHAM, YOU RECEIVED MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD VIAL FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether Mr. Fung received Mr. Simpson's blood vial from Detective Vannatter on the afternoon of June 13th at Rockingham. The witness answered ""YES.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear affirmation. This seems like a beneficial commitment because it directly answers the question without hedging, so I think it's a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in previous testimony about handling evidence, so this ""YES"" seems truthful. I'll rate it as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness discussed receiving evidence, so this aligns. Therefore, it's consistent, so 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about handling evidence, which is very relevant to the case. So, relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a simple ""YES,"" very clear. Clarity is 1.

Outcome: The questioner gets the information they sought, so the outcome favors the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The answer is a direct affirmation, which supports the questioner's line of inquiry. It's based on logical arguments, so reason 1.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper evidence collection procedures to avoid contamination and highlighted that Andrea Mazzola was primarily responsible for collecting blood samples at the Bundy crime scene. They questioned the accuracy of P_Witness's previous statements regarding Mazzola's training and the extent of her involvement.
   - **Witness Claim:** P_Witness acknowledged Mazzola's significant role in collecting evidence but maintained that he also participated in the process. He confirmed that he was present during the collection of blood drops and that he had concerns about contamination but did not recall specific details about his actions.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's training and her role in evidence collection. The defense suggested that Mazzola was still in training during the events, while P_Witness insisted she was a criminalist.
   - The defense questioned the timing of P_Witness's arrival at the crime scenes, suggesting that delays could have compromised evidence integrity. P_Witness confirmed the timeline but did not acknowledge any wrongdoing.
   - The defense raised concerns about the potential for cross-contamination of evidence, particularly regarding a blanket found at the crime scene and the handling of blood samples. P_Witness agreed that contamination could occur but did not concede that any specific mistakes were made in the evidence collection process.
   - The defense also challenged P_Witness's recollection of events and his motivations, suggesting that he might be covering for Detective Fuhrman, which P_Witness denied.

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant disputes over the handling of evidence, the qualifications of the personnel involved, and the potential for contamination, which are critical to the defense's strategy in questioning the integrity of the prosecution's evidence.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN RECOLLECT EXACTLY HOW THIS TRANSFER OCCURRED?
P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about how the witness handled Mr. Simpson's blood vial after receiving it from Detective Vannatter. The witness said, ""IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is being uncertain and not making a firm statement. They're using phrases like ""may have been"" and ""don't recall,"" which shows a lack of commitment. So, I think this is a Detrimental commitment because it benefits the questioner by showing uncertainty.

Next, truthfulness. The witness seems to be honest about not remembering the exact details, so I'll mark that as truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned receiving the vial but didn't specify how it was stored. This response doesn't contradict previous statements, so it's consistent.

Response relevance: The question is about the handling of evidence, which is very relevant to the case, so I'll rate it as very relevant.

Clarity: The witness is hedging and not providing a clear answer, so it's slightly unclear.

Outcome: The questioner benefits because the witness's uncertainty could cast doubt on the evidence handling.

Reason for outcome: The witness's lack of clear memory could be seen as a credibility issue, which the defense might exploit.

WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
P_WITNESS: I WOULDN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?
P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?

P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response to the defense's question. The question was about whether Detective Lange had taken the sneakers home. The witness answered, ""I don't know if he had taken them home or not."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness isn't making a definite statement; they're expressing uncertainty. So, this seems like a neutral commitment because they're not firmly agreeing or disagreeing with the question. It's more of a non-committal response.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness is being honest about their lack of knowledge. They're not claiming to know something they don't, so I would rate this as truthful.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, I don't have specific information here, but the response doesn't contradict anything previously stated. It seems consistent because the witness isn't providing new conflicting information.

The response is very relevant because it directly addresses the question about Detective Lange's actions. It's not going off-topic or avoiding the issue.

Clarity-wise, the response is slightly clear with some hedging. The witness uses ""I don't know,"" which introduces some uncertainty but still addresses the question directly.

As for the outcome, the questioner might not be fully satisfied because the witness didn't provide a definitive answer. However, the witness maintained their position without being evasive, so it's a bit of a draw, but I think the witness slightly holds their ground here.

The reason for this outcome is that the witness's response, while not definitive, is logical and doesn't provide the questioner with the information they were seeking. It's based on the witness's honest lack of knowledge rather than an emotional appeal or credibility attack.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN RECOLLECT EXACTLY HOW THIS TRANSFER OCCURRED?
P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response to the defense's question about whether it would be improper for detectives to keep Mr. Simpson's blood overnight before delivering it. The witness answered, ""THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness didn't give a direct yes or no but instead provided a conditional answer. This seems like a neutral commitment because they're not firmly stating it's improper or proper but rather making it dependent on storage conditions. So, I'd rate this as a 3 for neutral commitment.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is stating a fact based on standard procedures, so it seems truthful. They're not denying or lying about the protocols, just explaining the condition. So, I'll mark this as 1 for truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness discussed handling evidence and the importance of proper storage to prevent contamination. This response aligns with that, so it's consistent. Therefore, consistency is 0.

Response relevance: The question is about the propriety of the detectives' actions, and the witness's answer directly addresses that by bringing up storage conditions. It's very relevant because it speaks to the heart of the question. So, relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The answer is clear but includes a condition, which introduces some hedging. It's slightly clear with hedging, so I'll rate it a 2.

Outcome of the turn: The defense is trying to imply impropriety, but the witness's answer doesn't fully support that. By making it conditional, the witness avoids outright agreeing, which might weaken the defense's point. So, the witness maintains their ground, making the outcome in their favor. Thus, outcome_value is ""Witness.""

Reason for outcome: The witness used a logical argument about storage conditions, which is a solid point. So, the reason is 1, logical arguments are convincing.

DEFENSE: ""QUESTION: I TAKE IT AT SOME POINT IN TIME, YOU LEFT THE FOYER AREA AND RETURNED TO YOUR CRIME SCENE TRUCK? ""ANSWER: YES. ""QUESTION: ALL RIGHT. AND WERE YOU CARRYING THAT GRAY ENVELOPE? ""ANSWER: EITHER BY ITSELF IN A POSSE BOX OR IN A PAPER BAG. ""QUESTION: SO IT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE THREE WAYS OF CARRYING IT; EITHER BY ITSELF IN YOUR HAND, IN A PAPER BAG OR IN A POSSE BOX? ""ANSWER: YES."" WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS AND DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS YESTERDAY?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness was asked specific questions and if they gave certain answers the day before. The witness simply replied, ""YES, I DID."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is agreeing directly without any hesitation or hedging, so that's a high commitment. Since this directly benefits the questioner by confirming their point, I'd rate it as a 1 (detrimental commitment).

Next, truthfulness. The witness is confirming their previous testimony without any signs of deception, so I think they're being truthful here. That's a 1.

Consistency is also key. The witness's answer is consistent with their previous statements, so that's a 0 for consistency (meaning consistent).

Relevance-wise, the question is directly about the witness's prior testimony, which is very relevant to the case. So, relevance is a 1.

Clarity of the response is very clear because it's a straightforward ""yes"" without any ambiguity. That's a 1.

The outcome of this turn favors the questioner because the witness's confirmation supports the defense's line of questioning. So, the outcome is ""Questioner.""

The reason for this outcome is the logical arguments presented by the questioner, which the witness confirmed, making the defense's point stronger. So, the reason is 1 (logical arguments).

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?

DEFENSE: AND WHEN YOU SAW THESE SERIES OF TAPES, MR. FUNG, YOU REALIZED THAT YOU HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN A LIE, DIDN'T YOU?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was whether the witness was caught in a lie after seeing some tapes, and the witness answered ""NO."" I need to break this down based on the given properties.

First, commitment level. The witness gave a direct ""NO,"" which is a clear and firm answer. That seems like a beneficial commitment because it supports the witness's position, so I think it's a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is denying being caught in a lie. Without knowing the content of the tapes, it's hard to say, but the denial could be either truthful or not. However, the question implies that the tapes showed something contradictory, so maybe the witness isn't being entirely truthful. I'm leaning towards 0 here.

Consistency with previous testimony. The witness had earlier described handling the blood vial in a certain way, and now when confronted with tapes, they deny being caught in a lie. If the tapes contradict their earlier statements, this would be inconsistent. So, I think it's inconsistent, which is a 1.

Response relevance. The question is directly about the witness's honesty regarding their handling of evidence, which is very relevant to the case. So, relevance is 1.

Response clarity. The answer is a simple ""NO,"" which is very clear. So, clarity is 1.

Outcome of the turn. The questioner is trying to show the witness lied, but the witness denies it. Since the witness is firm, I think the witness wins this turn.

Reason for the outcome. The witness's denial is a direct and clear response, which can be seen as credible unless the tapes provide strong evidence otherwise. So, it's based on the credibility attack, which is reason 2.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper crime scene management to prevent contamination and highlighted inconsistencies in the witness's testimony regarding who collected blood samples and other evidence. They argued that Andrea Mazzola primarily collected the blood samples and that there were significant delays and potential mishandling of evidence, such as the blood samples being left in a hot truck for several hours.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged the principles of crime scene protection and confirmed that he was present during the evidence collection process. He admitted that Mazzola collected most of the blood samples but insisted that he also participated in the collection process, albeit to a lesser extent.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the accuracy of the witness's previous statements regarding Mazzola's training status and the extent of her involvement in collecting evidence. The defense suggested that the witness was reluctant to fully acknowledge Mazzola's role.
   - The defense questioned the witness about the timing of his arrival at the crime scenes and the implications of that timing on the integrity of the evidence collected. The witness confirmed delays in arriving at the scenes, which the defense argued could have compromised the evidence.
   - The defense raised concerns about the potential for cross-contamination of evidence, particularly regarding a blanket that was placed at the crime scene, and the witness acknowledged that this could be a source of contamination.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's handling of blood samples, questioning the appropriateness of leaving them in a hot truck and the implications of that for the evidence's integrity. The witness admitted that it could be considered a mistake not to use the refrigerator in the truck.

Overall, the defense aimed to undermine the credibility of the evidence collection process and the witness's reliability, while the witness maintained that he followed proper procedures, albeit with some admissions of potential errors.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question is about whether the witness was caught in a lie regarding how he carried the blood vial. The witness answered, ""THAT'S WHAT I STATED."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is reaffirming his previous statement without adding new information, so it's a neutral commitment because he's not helping either side more than the other.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is sticking to his story, but the defense is implying he was inconsistent. Without more context, it's hard to say if he's truthful, but I'll lean towards him being truthful as he's not changing his statement.

Consistency with previous testimony: The witness is consistent because he's repeating what he said before. So, consistency is maintained.

Response relevance: The answer is very relevant because it directly addresses the question about the blood vial handling.

Clarity: The response is very clear and straightforward without any hedging.

Outcome: The questioner (defense) might be trying to challenge the witness's credibility, but the witness's consistent answer doesn't give them an advantage. So, the witness maintains their position.

Reason for outcome: The witness's consistent and clear answer doesn't provide new ammo for the defense, so it's more of a credibility issue rather than a logical argument or emotional appeal.

   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that the integrity of the crime scene was compromised due to improper handling and collection of evidence, particularly by Andrea Mazzola, who they argued was primarily responsible for collecting blood samples and other evidence. They highlighted the importance of protecting the crime scene to prevent contamination and questioned the witness's reliability and accuracy in recounting events.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintained that he was present during the evidence collection and that while Mazzola did collect a significant portion of the blood samples, he also participated in the process. He acknowledged the importance of protecting the crime scene but defended the actions taken during the evidence collection.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's involvement in collecting blood samples, with the defense suggesting she was primarily responsible while the witness conceded she did most but not all of the work.
   - The defense questioned the witness's recollection of events, particularly regarding the timeline of their arrival at the crime scenes and the handling of evidence, suggesting that the witness's previous statements were inconsistent.
   - The defense also raised concerns about the potential for contamination due to the handling of evidence, such as a blanket that could have transferred hairs and fibers, while the witness acknowledged the possibility but did not fully agree with the defense's implications of negligence.
   - The defense sought to undermine the credibility of the witness by suggesting he was covering for other detectives and had been caught in inconsistencies regarding the handling of blood evidence, which the witness denied. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant disputes over the procedures followed at the crime scenes and the reliability of the witness's testimony regarding evidence collection and contamination risks.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question is about whether the witness was caught in a lie after seeing videotapes. The witness answered, ""THE--I--THAT DIDN'T COME TO MY ATTENTION AT THAT TIME, NO.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness seems to be avoiding a direct answer, which might be detrimental because it doesn't help the questioner. So, I think it's a detrimental commitment, which is level 1.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is denying being caught in a lie, but the context suggests there might be inconsistency. So, I'm leaning towards not truthful, which is 0.

Consistency with previous testimony: The witness had previously stated they carried the blood vial in a certain way, but the videotape seems to contradict that. So, this is inconsistent, which is 1.

Response relevance: The answer is directly addressing the question about the videotape, so it's very relevant, which is 1.

Clarity: The response is a bit hesitant and unclear, so I'd rate it as slightly unclear, which is 3.

Outcome: The questioner is challenging the witness's credibility, so the outcome favors the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The questioner is attacking the witness's credibility, which is reason 2.

P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, AT THIS POINT IN THE TIME, JUDGE ITO ASKED YOU WHAT WAS IN THE PLASTIC BAG BEING CARRIED BY MISS MAZZOLA?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about what was in the plastic bag being carried by Miss Mazzola, and the witness answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES,"" which is a clear affirmation. This seems like a beneficial commitment because it directly answers the question without hedging, so I'll rate it as a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in their previous testimony about handling evidence, so this ""YES"" seems truthful. I'll mark it as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: The witness has been talking about collecting evidence and handling bags, so this ""YES"" aligns with that. Therefore, it's consistent, so 0.

Response relevance: The question is about the contents of a specific plastic bag, which is directly relevant to the case. So, very relevant, rating 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a simple ""YES,"" which is very clear. So, clarity is 1.

Outcome of the turn: The questioner gets a clear answer, which helps their case, so the outcome favors the Questioner.

Reason for outcome: The answer is clear and directly relevant, so it's based on logical arguments, reason 1.

P_WITNESS: SHE DID MOST OF IT, YES.

DEFENSE: WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF CRIME SCENE CONTAMINATION TO FIRST PROTECT THESCENE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?
P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?

DEFENSE: DID YOU TELL ANYONE ON AUGUST 8TH THAT YOU VISITED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 6TH TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?

P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The witness said, ""I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE PLASTIC BAG."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the commitment level. The witness is making a statement about forgetting something. Forgetting can sometimes be a way to avoid a direct answer, but in this case, it's a straightforward admission. So, I think it's a neutral commitment because it doesn't strongly benefit either side; it's just a statement of fact about their memory.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is saying they forgot, which is a common human experience. There's no immediate indication that this is a lie, so I'll lean towards truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony. Earlier, the witness mentioned handling the blood vial in a certain way, but now they're saying they forgot about the plastic bag. This could be inconsistent because if they forgot, it might imply they didn't handle it as they previously stated. So, I think this is inconsistent.

Relevance. The question was about what was in the plastic bag, so the response is directly relevant. It answers the question, even if the answer is about forgetting.

Clarity. The response is clear and straightforward. The witness isn't hedging or being vague, just stating they forgot.

Outcome. The questioner is trying to find out about the plastic bag, and the witness's forgetfulness might hinder the questioner's line of inquiry. So, the witness's response doesn't help the questioner, making the witness the outcome winner here.

Reason for outcome. The witness's forgetfulness is a credibility issue because it affects the reliability of their testimony. This could be seen as a credibility attack, which benefits the witness's side.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is truthful but inconsistent, and it affects the questioner's ability to get a clear answer, so the outcome favors the witness due to credibility concerns.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: ISN'T IT TRUE, MR. FUNG, THAT YOU NEVER REMOVED ANYTHING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THAT BRONCO DOOR ON JULY 6TH FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING A PRESUMPTIVE TEST?
P_WITNESS: I DID PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON A DARK STAIN AT THE DOOR SILL OF THE DRIVER DOOR.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I WENT THERE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE DRIVER DOOR SILL AND PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON IT.

DEFENSE: DID YOU TELL ANYONE ON AUGUST 8TH THAT YOU VISITED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 6TH TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL SAYING THAT.*****

P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?

P_WITNESS: THAT'S WHAT I STATED.

DEFENSE: BUT WHEN YOU SAW THE VIDEOTAPE, THESE VIDEOTAPES, YOU REALIZED, SIR, THAT THAT--DETECTIVE VANNATTER'S CAR WASN'T THERE WHEN YOU PUT THE BROWN PAPER BAGS AND THE POSSE BOX WAS PUT IN THE REAR OF THE CRIME SCENE VEHICLE, CORRECT?
P_WITNESS: THE--I--THAT DIDN'T COME TO MY ATTENTION AT THAT TIME, NO.

DEFENSE: NOW, AT THIS POINT IN THE TIME, JUDGE ITO ASKED YOU WHAT WAS IN THE PLASTIC BAG BEING CARRIED BY MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD HIM THE GRAY MANILA ENVELOPE CONTAINING MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD SAMPLE?
P_WITNESS: I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE PLASTIC BAG.

DEFENSE: NOW, ON THIS DOCUMENT, YOU CAN READ ALONG IF IT HELPS, WITH YOUR COPY, IF YOU WANT, IT REFERS TO ITEM 17, ""ONE PAIR OF TENNIS SHOES, REEBOK, RECEIVED IN SEROLOGY BY D. FUNG FROM DETECTIVE LANGE,"" CORRECT?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about a document referring to item 17, which is a pair of Reebok tennis shoes received by D. Fung from Detective Lange. The witness simply answered ""YES."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a straightforward ""YES"" without any hesitation or elaboration. This seems like a detrimental commitment because it directly answers the question, which could benefit the questioner (the defense) by confirming a fact that might be relevant to their case.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness's answer is a simple affirmation. There's no indication of deception here, so I would rate this as truthful.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, the witness has been providing information about handling evidence, including receiving items from detectives. This response aligns with that pattern, so it's consistent.

The response is very relevant because it directly pertains to the handling of evidence, which is a key point in the cross-examination. It helps the defense establish a chain of custody or potential mishandling.

Clarity-wise, the answer is very clear. A simple ""YES"" leaves no room for ambiguity.

In terms of the outcome, the questioner (defense) benefits because the answer confirms a specific transfer of evidence, which could be used to challenge the handling procedures. The reason for this outcome is the logical argument presented by the defense, which the witness's answer supports.

So, putting it all together, the witness's response is clear, consistent, and directly answers the question, which helps the defense's case.

DEFENSE: UP IN THE UPPER RIGHT-HAND CORNER JUST WHERE ""D. FUNG"" IS THERE IS A DATE, ""6/14/94""?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about a document that refers to item 17, a pair of Reebok tennis shoes received by D. Fung from Detective Lange on 6/14/94. The witness answered, ""THAT'S CORRECT.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is agreeing with the statement, which seems straightforward. There's no hedging or uncertainty, so it's a clear commitment. Since this supports the questioner's point, I think it's a detrimental commitment, which would be level 1.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is confirming a specific fact from a document. There's no indication of deception here, so I consider this truthful, which is a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: The witness has been consistent in acknowledging the receipt of evidence. There's no inconsistency noted here, so it's consistent, which is 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the document and the receipt of evidence, which is very relevant to the case. So, relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The answer is clear and direct without any ambiguity, so clarity is 1.

Outcome of the current turn: The questioner is trying to establish a fact, and the witness's confirmation helps the questioner. So, the outcome favors the questioner.

Reason for the outcome: The witness's confirmation is based on a logical argument presented by the questioner, so the reason is logical arguments being convincing, which is 1.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about a document that refers to Item 17 and Item 18, specifically about receiving a blood sample from Detective Lange. The witness answered, ""THAT'S CORRECT.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is agreeing with the statement, which seems straightforward. It doesn't show any hesitation, so I think it's a beneficial commitment because it supports the questioner's point. So, I'll rate it as 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is confirming the document's content without any signs of evasion. It seems truthful, so I'll mark it as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness discussed handling the blood sample and interactions with detectives. This response aligns with that, so it's consistent. I'll go with 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the document and the items listed, which is very relevant to the case. So, relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The answer is clear and direct without any hedging. Clarity is 1.

Outcome of the turn: The questioner is getting a confirmation that supports their line of questioning, so the questioner wins this turn.

Reason for the outcome: The witness's confirmation is based on the document's content, which is a logical argument. So, reason 1.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper evidence collection procedures to avoid contamination and questioned the witness's reliability and accuracy in recounting the evidence collection process, particularly regarding Andrea Mazzola's role in swatching blood drops and the handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement about the extent of Mazzola's involvement in collecting blood evidence, with the defense suggesting she was primarily responsible while the witness conceded she did a good portion but not exclusively.
   - The defense questioned the witness's response time to the crime scene and whether it was appropriate, suggesting that delays could compromise evidence integrity. The witness confirmed the timeline but did not acknowledge any wrongdoing.
   - The defense raised concerns about the potential for cross-contamination of evidence, particularly regarding a blanket used at the crime scene and the handling of blood samples, while the witness acknowledged the risks but did not concede that any mistakes were made.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's recollection of events and the accuracy of his previous testimonies, suggesting inconsistencies in his statements about the handling of evidence, particularly regarding the blood vial from Mr. Simpson.

Overall, the defense aimed to undermine the credibility of the witness and the procedures followed during evidence collection, while the witness maintained that he acted within the protocols of crime scene investigation.

SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: AT SOME TIME AFTER JUNE 15TH DID ANYBODY EVER QUESTION YOU ABOUT HOW THE BLOOD VIAL HAD BEEN LABELED 18 IN MR. YAMAUCHI'S REPORTS BUT YOU PUT IT IN YOUR PROPERTY REPORT AS 17?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether someone had questioned the witness about the labeling of the blood vial as item 18 in Mr. Yamauchi's reports but item 17 in the witness's property report. The witness answered, ""BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT IT, YES.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is agreeing that they were questioned about it, which directly answers the question. So, it's a clear commitment, but it's detrimental because it benefits the questioner by showing a potential inconsistency. So, I think the commitment level is 1.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is stating a fact about being questioned, which seems straightforward. There's no obvious sign of deception here, so I'll mark it as truthful (1).

Consistency with previous testimony: The witness's answer here doesn't contradict earlier statements, so it's consistent (0).

Response relevance: The answer is directly related to the question about the labeling discrepancy, so it's very relevant (1).

Response clarity: The answer is concise and clear without hedging, so it's very clear (1).

Outcome: The questioner benefits because the witness's answer acknowledges the issue, so the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The witness's admission supports the questioner's point about potential inconsistencies, so it's a credibility attack (2).

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that the integrity of the crime scene was compromised due to improper handling and collection of evidence, particularly by Andrea Mazzola, who they argued primarily collected blood samples and other evidence without adequate supervision or proper procedure.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintained that he was present during the evidence collection and that while Mazzola did collect a significant portion of the evidence, he also participated in the process. He asserted that he followed proper procedures and that any mistakes were not significant enough to undermine the overall integrity of the evidence.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's experience and role in collecting evidence. The defense suggested that she was still in training and not qualified to handle the evidence, while the witness insisted she was a criminalist and capable of performing her duties.
   - The defense questioned the timing and conditions under which evidence was collected, particularly the blood samples, suggesting that delays and improper storage could have led to contamination. The witness acknowledged some issues but defended the overall process as acceptable.
   - The defense also raised concerns about the potential for cross-contamination of evidence, particularly regarding a blanket found at the crime scene, while the witness acknowledged the possibility but did not concede that it was a definitive issue.
   - The defense attempted to highlight inconsistencies in the witness's previous testimonies and statements regarding the handling of blood samples, suggesting that the witness was not being truthful or was confused about the events. The witness denied any intent to mislead the court.

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant disputes over the handling of evidence, the qualifications of the personnel involved, and the potential for contamination, which are critical to the defense's argument regarding the integrity of the evidence presented in the case.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?

P_WITNESS: BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT IT, YES.

DEFENSE: AND THEN AFTER WRITING THAT NOTATION YOU DECIDED TO ERASE IT?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness erased a notation after being questioned about the labeling of the blood vial. The witness answered, ""I DID ERASE IT FROM WHAT IS HERE, YES.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is directly admitting to erasing the notation, which seems like a detrimental commitment because it benefits the questioner by showing that the witness made an alteration. So, I think the commitment level is 1.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness is admitting to erasing, which is a fact. There's no indication of lying here, so I'll mark it as truthful (1).

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, the witness had mentioned the blood vial and labeling before, but this specific action of erasing wasn't discussed earlier. So, it's consistent with the previous testimony about handling the vial, but the erasure is a new point. I'm a bit unsure, but I think it's consistent, so 0.

The response is very relevant because it directly answers the question about the erasure, so relevance is 1.

Clarity-wise, the response is straightforward without hedging, so clarity is 1.

The outcome of this turn favors the questioner because the admission of erasure could imply an attempt to hide something, which the defense can use to challenge the witness's credibility. So, the outcome is Questioner.

The reason for this outcome is the credibility attack on the witness, as the admission of erasing a notation can undermine their trustworthiness. So, the reason is 2.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: AND IN GOING THROUGH THE PAGES OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST, YOU SAW ANOTHER DOCUMENT THAT CREATED A PROBLEM FOR YOU, DIDN'T YOU?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The witness was asked a question about another document that created a problem, and they responded with, ""WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?"" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is asking for clarification, which doesn't commit them to any specific answer. So, it's a neutral commitment, which would be a 3.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness is being honest by stating they don't understand the reference. So, I'd rate that as truthful, which is a 1.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, the witness hasn't provided any information here that contradicts or supports earlier statements. So, it's consistent, which is a 0.

The response is very relevant because it directly addresses the question, even though it's a request for clarification. So, relevance is a 1.

Clarity-wise, the response is very clear. The witness is straightforward in asking for more information. So, clarity is a 1.

As for the outcome, the questioner might be trying to press the witness on a point, but the witness's request for clarification doesn't concede anything. So, the witness maintains control here, making the outcome in their favor.

The reason for this outcome is that the witness is using a credible tactic by seeking clarification, which doesn't weaken their position. So, it's a credibility-based reason, which is option 2.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper evidence collection procedures to avoid contamination and questioned the witness's reliability and accuracy in recounting the evidence collection process, particularly regarding Andrea Mazzola's role in swatching blood drops and the handling of evidence at the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintained that he was present during the evidence collection and confirmed that Mazzola collected a significant portion of the blood samples, but he also acknowledged his involvement in the process.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The witness was asked about a specific document, page 4 of the crime scene checklist, and they responded with ""WHAT ABOUT IT?"" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness's response is very brief and doesn't provide any information. It doesn't confirm or deny anything, so it's a non-committal answer. That would be a 4 on the commitment scale because it's no commitment made.

Next, truthfulness. The witness isn't providing any false information here; they're just not answering the question. So, I'd say it's truthful, which is a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Since the response doesn't provide any new information or contradict previous statements, it's consistent. So, that's a 0.

Response relevance: The question was about a specific document, and the witness's answer doesn't address it at all. It's irrelevant in this context, so a 4.

Clarity: The response is very unclear because it doesn't provide any meaningful information. It's just a vague question, so that's a 4.

Outcome: The questioner is trying to get information about the document, but the witness isn't providing it. So, the witness is maintaining control here, making the outcome in their favor. So, the outcome is the witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness is using a credibility attack by not answering, which fits into category 2.

DEFENSE: AND THEN AFTER WRITING THAT NOTATION YOU DECIDED TO ERASE IT?
P_WITNESS: I DID ERASE IT FROM WHAT IS HERE, YES.

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
P_WITNESS: WHAT ABOUT IT?

Current Exchange:

P_WITNESS: I DON'T REMEMBER MY EXACT WORDS.

DEFENSE: ISN'T IT TRUE THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 55 AND 56, THAT MISS MAZZOLA WAS THE ONE WHO SWATCHED EVERY BLOODSTAIN AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE, NO.

DEFENSE: WHICH ONE DID YOU SWATCH?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL EXACTLY WHICH ONES I ASSISTED HER WITH, BUT THERE WERE PORTIONS OF STAINS WHERE IACTUALLY TOOK THE TWEEZERS AND DID THE MANIPULATION MYSELF.

DEFENSE: ROCKINGHAM, SHE SWATCHED THE RED STAIN ON THE HANDLE OF THE BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: UNDER MY DIRECT SUPERVISION, YES.

WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
P_WITNESS: I WOULDN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY.

P_WITNESS: SHE DID MOST OF IT, YES.

DEFENSE: WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF CRIME SCENE CONTAMINATION TO FIRST PROTECT THESCENE?

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?
P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I WENT THERE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE DRIVER DOOR SILL AND PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON IT.

DEFENSE: DID YOU TELL ANYONE ON AUGUST 8TH THAT YOU VISITED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 6TH TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL SAYING THAT.*****

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN RECOLLECT EXACTLY HOW THIS TRANSFER OCCURRED?
P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?

P_WITNESS: BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT IT, YES.

DEFENSE: AND THEN AFTER WRITING THAT NOTATION YOU DECIDED TO ERASE IT?
P_WITNESS: I DID ERASE IT FROM WHAT IS HERE, YES.

DEFENSE: AND IN GOING THROUGH THE PAGES OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST, YOU SAW ANOTHER DOCUMENT THAT CREATED A PROBLEM FOR YOU, DIDN'T YOU?
P_WITNESS: WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
P_WITNESS: WHAT ABOUT IT?

DEFENSE: IF THERE WERE SOMETHING FILLED IN THERE THAT SAID 5:15 AS TO THE TIME LEAVING SCENE, THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE GRAY ENVELOPE YOU RECEIVED FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question is about whether a specific time noted on a document would be inconsistent with what the witness wrote on the gray envelope he received from Detective Vannatter. The witness answered, ""IF THERE WAS THAT TIME THERE, YES, IT WOULD.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is agreeing that if a certain time is on the document, it would be inconsistent. This seems like a detrimental commitment because it potentially benefits the questioner by pointing out an inconsistency. So, I'd rate this as a 1.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness is being straightforward here. He's not denying the possibility of inconsistency but is conditionally agreeing based on the presence of the time. So, I think he's being truthful, which is a 1.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, the witness has been questioned about various details, and this specific point about the time could be a new inconsistency. If he previously stated a different time or handling, this would be inconsistent. So, I'll mark this as inconsistent, which is a 1.

The response is very relevant because it directly addresses the question about the time discrepancy on the documents. So, relevance is a 1.

Clarity-wise, the witness's answer is slightly clear but uses a conditional statement. It's not entirely direct, so I'll rate it as slightly clear with hedging, which is a 2.

As for the outcome, the questioner is benefiting because the witness is acknowledging a potential inconsistency, which could undermine his credibility. So, the outcome favors the questioner.

The reason for this outcome is the logical argument presented by the questioner, pointing out a possible inconsistency in the documentation. This falls under logical arguments being convincing, so reason 1.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that the integrity of the crime scene was compromised due to the actions of the criminalists, particularly focusing on the collection of blood evidence and the potential for contamination.

""ANSWER: I TRANSFERRED THE BLOOD DROPS ONTO CLOTH SQUARES OR CLOTH SWATCHES. WHAT I DID WAS WET THE CLOTH SWATCHES WITH DISTILLED WATER AND THEN APPLIED THEM TO THE STAIN, THE RED STAINS WHICH WERE LATER DETERMINED TO BE BLOOD, AND THEY WERE TRANSFERRED ON -- IN THAT METHOD."" WERE YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS, DID YOU GIVE THOSE ANSWERS?
P_WITNESS: YES, I DID.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WASN'T ACCURATE TESTIMONY, WAS IT?
P_WITNESS: IT WAS ACCURATE IN THE SENSE THAT I DID PERFORM SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON -- BUT I DON'T RECALL EXACTLYWHICH ONES I DID THEM ON.

DEFENSE: AND DID YOU HAVE ANY RELUCTANCE IN TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS ANDREA MAZZOLA THAT SWATCHED PRIMARILY ALL THE ITEMS? YOU SAID YOU SWATCHED ONE OR TWO TIMES, THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THAT.

DEFENSE: SHE DID PRIMARILY ALL THE BUNDY BLOOD DROPS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: SHE DID A GOOD PORTION OF THEM, YES.

DEFENSE: AND SHE DID THE ROCKINGHAM BLOOD STAINS EXCLUSIVELY?
P_WITNESS: I WOULDN'T SAY EXCLUSIVELY.

DEFENSE: YES. BUT SHE DID THE MOST.
P_WITNESS: SHE DID MOST OF IT, YES.

DEFENSE: WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF CRIME SCENE CONTAMINATION TO FIRST PROTECT THESCENE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IF YOU SAW DETECTIVES USING PROCEDURES WHICH YOU FELT WOULD IMPAIR THE INTEGRITY OFEVIDENCE AS THEY WERE COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU OBJECT?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE CRIMINALISTS SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE CRIME SCENE AS SOONAS POSSIBLE?
P_WITNESS: ONCE WE RECEIVE A CALL WE TRY TO RESPOND WITHIN AN HOUR, IF IT IS POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: OKAY. SO MISS MAZZOLA CALLED YOU AT 5:30?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU GOT TO THE SCENE AT ROCKINGHAM AT WHAT TIME YOU ARE TELLING US?
P_WITNESS: 7:10.

DEFENSE: SO YOUR RESPONSE TIME TO ROCKINGHAM WAS AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT WAS.

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE ROCKINGHAM CRIME SCENE DID DETECTIVE VANNATTER TELL THAT YOU DETECTIVE LANGE WAS WAITING FOR YOU AT BUNDY?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU BEGAN COLLECTING THE BLOOD DROPS AT BUNDY AT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, AROUND THERE.

DEFENSE: YOU BEGAN PUTTING THEM IN PLASTIC BAGS AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK, 11:30, YOU AND MISS MAZZOLA?
P_WITNESS: APPROXIMATELY.

DEFENSE: AND IT WAS HOT INSIDE THAT TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE WERE PERIODS WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WASN'T GETTING TOO HOT.

DEFENSE: AND YOU DID NOT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TAKING THOSE WET BLOOD STAINS OUT OF THOSE PLASTIC BAGS UNTIL AROUND 6:30 IN THE EVENING?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: YOU DIDN'T USE THAT?
P_WITNESS: NO. THAT IS BECAUSE THE REFRIGERATOR DOESN'T -- WELL, IT STOPS WORKING AFTER SEVERAL HOURS. IT DOESN'T KEEP WORKING.

DEFENSE: ISN'T IT TRUE, MR. FUNG, THAT YOU NEVER REMOVED ANYTHING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THAT BRONCO DOOR ON JULY 6TH FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING A PRESUMPTIVE TEST?
P_WITNESS: I DID PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON A DARK STAIN AT THE DOOR SILL OF THE DRIVER DOOR.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I WENT THERE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE DRIVER DOOR SILL AND PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON IT.

DEFENSE: DID YOU TELL ANYONE ON AUGUST 8TH THAT YOU VISITED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 6TH TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL SAYING THAT.*****

DEFENSE: AND IS YOUR TESTIMONY, SIR, WITH RESPECT TO RED STAINS IN THE BRONCO THAT YOU'VE GIVEN TO THIS JURY IN ANY WAY MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO COVER FOR DETECTIVE FUHRMAN?
P_WITNESS: NO.*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, YOU'VE TOLD US THAT ON THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 13TH AT ROCKINGHAM, YOU RECEIVED MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD VIAL FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN RECOLLECT EXACTLY HOW THIS TRANSFER OCCURRED?
P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?
P_WITNESS: THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1995 9:20 A.M.

DEFENSE: ""QUESTION: I TAKE IT AT SOME POINT IN TIME, YOU LEFT THE FOYER AREA AND RETURNED TO YOUR CRIME SCENE TRUCK? ""ANSWER: YES. ""QUESTION: ALL RIGHT. AND WERE YOU CARRYING THAT GRAY ENVELOPE?

P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: WELL, YOU HAD TOLD THIS JURY YESTERDAY THAT YOU CARRIED THE BLOOD VIAL--BLOOD SAMPLE EITHER IN A BROWN PAPER BAG IN THE POSSE BOX OR IN YOUR HANDS, CORRECT?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S WHAT I STATED.

DEFENSE: BUT WHEN YOU SAW THE VIDEOTAPE, THESE VIDEOTAPES, YOU REALIZED, SIR, THAT THAT--DETECTIVE VANNATTER'S CAR WASN'T THERE WHEN YOU PUT THE BROWN PAPER BAGS AND THE POSSE BOX WAS PUT IN THE REAR OF THE CRIME SCENE VEHICLE, CORRECT?

DEFENSE: AT SOME TIME AFTER JUNE 15TH DID ANYBODY EVER QUESTION YOU ABOUT HOW THE BLOOD VIAL HAD BEEN LABELED 18 IN MR. YAMAUCHI'S REPORTS BUT YOU PUT IT IN YOUR PROPERTY REPORT AS 17?
P_WITNESS: BEING QUESTIONED ABOUT IT, YES.

DEFENSE: AND THEN AFTER WRITING THAT NOTATION YOU DECIDED TO ERASE IT?
P_WITNESS: I DID ERASE IT FROM WHAT IS HERE, YES.

DEFENSE: AND IN GOING THROUGH THE PAGES OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST, YOU SAW ANOTHER DOCUMENT THAT CREATED A PROBLEM FOR YOU, DIDN'T YOU?
P_WITNESS: WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
P_WITNESS: WHAT ABOUT IT?

DEFENSE: IF THERE WERE SOMETHING FILLED IN THERE THAT SAID 5:15 AS TO THE TIME LEAVING SCENE, THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE GRAY ENVELOPE YOU RECEIVED FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?
P_WITNESS: IF THERE WAS THAT TIME THERE, YES, IT WOULD.

DEFENSE: AND THAT IS WHY YOU DESTROYED THE ORIGINAL PAGE 4, MR. FUNG?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness destroyed the original page 4 of the crime scene checklist because it was inconsistent with the time he wrote on the gray envelope. The witness answered, ""THAT IS NOT TRUE.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is denying the accusation directly, so that's a beneficial commitment for the witness, which would be a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is denying the destruction, but considering the context, there might be some inconsistency in his previous statements. So, I'm leaning towards him not being entirely truthful, which is a 0.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness had some inconsistencies, especially regarding the handling of evidence and times. This denial might be consistent with his previous denials, but the underlying issue of time inconsistency could make this a bit inconsistent. However, since he's denying it outright, I'll say it's consistent, so 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the destruction of a document, which is very relevant to the case, so that's a 1.

Response clarity: The answer is a clear ""THAT IS NOT TRUE,"" so very clear, which is a 1.

Outcome: The witness is denying the accusation, so he's maintaining his position, making the outcome in his favor, so Witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness used a credibility attack by denying the accusation, which is reason 2.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that the integrity of the crime scene was compromised due to improper handling of evidence, particularly regarding the collection of blood samples and the presence of a blanket that could lead to contamination. They argued that the procedures followed by the criminalists, including the response time to the crime scene and the handling of evidence, were flawed and could have affected the reliability of the evidence.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintained that they followed proper procedures and that while there may have been some issues, they did not significantly compromise the integrity of the evidence collected.

   - The defense raised concerns about the handling of a blanket found at the crime scene, suggesting it could have introduced contamination. The witness agreed that contamination was possible but noted that the blanket's cleanliness would affect the outcome.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's recollection of events and the accuracy of their previous testimonies, suggesting inconsistencies in their statements regarding the handling of evidence, particularly the blood vial from Mr. Simpson.

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant conflicts regarding the procedures followed at the crime scenes, the handling of evidence, and the reliability of witness testimonies.

P_WITNESS: I DON'T SPECIFICALLY RECALL IF HE MENTIONED IT WAS DETECTIVE LANGE HIMSELF, BUT HE DID MENTION THERE WASANOTHER SCENE AT BUNDY.

DEFENSE: AND DID HE TELL YOU THAT AT THAT SCENE IT WAS A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND THERE WERE TWOVICTIMS' BODIES THERE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: GENERALLY SPEAKING, ISN'T IT CERTAINLY DESIRABLE FOR THE CRIMINALISTS TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDESCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND THE REASON THAT YOU WANT TO ARRIVE AT A HOMICIDE SCENE BEFORE THE CORONERS IS YOU WANT ANOPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE SCENE AND THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE BEFORE THE BODIES ARE REMOVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IT WAS AFTER YOUR CONVERSATION, YOUR INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH DETECTIVE VANNATTER, UMM, THATYOU REALIZED THAT, UMM, ANDREA MAZZOLA COULD NOT ACT AS THE, QUOTE, OFFICER IN CHARGE, OF THIS CASE?
P_WITNESS: I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT THAT I BE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE.

DEFENSE: AT 7:15 WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT ROCKINGHAM YOU KNEW THAT ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASEWAS MR. SIMPSON'S EX-WIFE?
P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE AT MR. SIMPSON'S HOUSE?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THAT WAS HIS RESIDENCE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU KNOW THAT DETECTIVE VANNATTER REGARDED MR. SIMPSON AS A SUSPECT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL IF HE RELAYED THAT TO ME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: MAYBE WE COULD TURN NOW TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU COLLECTED AT ROCKINGHAM FOR A MINUTE.YOU INDICATED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RED BLOOD DROPS; IS THAT CORRECT, THAT YOU OBSERVED?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: NOW, IN TERMS OF THESE RED STAINS THAT YOU FOUND, WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PATTERN OF RED STAINS THATYOU FOUND WAS LEADING FROM THE RESIDENCE TO THE BRONCO OR THE BRONCO TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE RESIDENCE?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE BUNDY CRIME SCENE. YOU ARRIVED THERE AT ABOUT WHAT TIME?
P_WITNESS: I ARRIVED THERE AT 10:15 IN THE MORNING.

DEFENSE: AND YOU TOLD US THAT YOU HAD HEARD OR YOU BELIEVED AT THAT TIME THAT THE VICTIMS WERE FIRSTDISCOVERED SOMETIME IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVED AT BUNDY, IT WAS SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF 10 HOURSTO YOUR KNOWLEDGE FROM WHEN THE BODIES WERE FIRST FOUND?
P_WITNESS: SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

DEFENSE: NOW, WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU SAW THAT THERE WAS A BLANKET OVER THE BODY OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: SO LET'S SEE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF SEVEN HOURS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: IS THERE A REFRIGERATOR IN THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: THERE IS ONE, YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU REMOVED SOME OF THAT STAIN, SOME OF THAT EVIDENCE FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR TEST?
P_WITNESS: YES..*****

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU WENT OUT ON JULY 6TH TO LOOK AT THE BRONCO SIMPLY TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I WENT THERE SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THE DRIVER DOOR SILL AND PERFORM A PRESUMPTIVE TEST ON IT.

DEFENSE: DID YOU TELL ANYONE ON AUGUST 8TH THAT YOU VISITED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 6TH TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY FOR COURT?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL SAYING THAT.*****

P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU CAN RECOLLECT EXACTLY HOW THIS TRANSFER OCCURRED?
P_WITNESS: DETECTIVE VANNATTER SAID -- SAID TO ME OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I HAVE MR. SIMPSON'S BLOOD AND I WANT YOU TO BOOK IT (INDICATING). HE GAVE ME THE ENVELOPE CONTAINING THE VIAL.

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?
P_WITNESS: IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PAPER BAG, BUT I DON'T RECALL IF I ACTUALLY DID PUT IT IN THERE OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE -- IN A POSSE BOX. *****

DEFENSE: WHEN YOU SAW DETECTIVE LANGE ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 14TH WITH THE SNEAKERS, YOU REALIZED THAT HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME?
P_WITNESS: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD TAKEN THEM HOME OR NOT.

DEFENSE: IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOM AND PRACTICE OF YOUR LABORATORY AND ITS WORKINGS WITH DETECTIVES, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPROPER IF EITHER OF THESE DETECTIVES HAD KEPT THE BLOOD DRAWN FROM MR. SIMPSON ON JUNE 13TH OVERNIGHT IN THEIR PERSONAL POSSESSION AND THEN DELIVERED IT TO YOU THE NEXT MORNING ON JUNE 14TH?
P_WITNESS: THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW THE BLOOD WAS STORED IN THERE WHILE IT WAS IN THEIR CUSTODY.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1995 9:20 A.M.

P_WITNESS: WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.

P_WITNESS: IF THERE WAS THAT TIME THERE, YES, IT WOULD.

DEFENSE: AND THAT IS WHY YOU DESTROYED THE ORIGINAL PAGE 4, MR. FUNG?

ONE OF THOSE PAGES DOESN'T HAVE STAPLE HOLES IN IT, MR. FUNG?
","Okay, so I need to evaluate the witness's response based on the given properties. The response is ""THAT'S CORRECT."" 

First, looking at commitment level. The witness is agreeing with the questioner's statement, which seems to be about a page without staple holes. Since the witness is affirming the questioner's point, it's a beneficial commitment for the questioner. So I think it's a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is simply agreeing, so unless there's evidence they're lying, I'll assume they're truthful. So 1.

Consistency with previous testimony. The response is consistent because the witness had earlier agreed about the page without staple holes. So 0.

Response relevance. The question is about the crime scene checklist, which is directly relevant to the case. So very relevant, which is 1.

Response clarity. The answer is straightforward and clear, so very clear, which is 1.

Current turn outcome. The questioner is pointing out an inconsistency or issue with the documents, which benefits their case. So the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

Reason for outcome. The questioner is using logical arguments about the documents to challenge the witness's credibility. So reason 1.

P_WITNESS: I DON'T RECALL BEING THERE THAT SOON. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE BODY OF MISS SIMPSON WAS BEING PROCESSED.

DEFENSE: IT WAS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREA WHERE MISS SIMPSON'S BODY WAS?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN IN YOUR INVESTIGATION THAT DAY THAT THE BLANKET HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE BODY?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND YOU CAME TO LEARN THAT THAT BLANKET HAD COME FROM THE HOME OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON?
P_WITNESS: SINCE THEN, YES.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, AGAIN, ASSUMING THAT MR. SIMPSON HAD BEEN IN THE BUNDY RESIDENCE AND SAT OR LAIDON THAT BLANKET, SHED HAIRS ON THAT BLANKET AND THAT BLANKET IS TAKEN AND PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRIME SCENE,COULD THAT IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION BE A SOURCE OF SECONDARY TRANSFER OF HIS HAIRS TO THE CRIME SCENE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
P_WITNESS: WHAT ABOUT IT?

DEFENSE: IF THERE WERE SOMETHING FILLED IN THERE THAT SAID 5:15 AS TO THE TIME LEAVING SCENE, THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE GRAY ENVELOPE YOU RECEIVED FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?
P_WITNESS: IF THERE WAS THAT TIME THERE, YES, IT WOULD.

DEFENSE: AND THAT IS WHY YOU DESTROYED THE ORIGINAL PAGE 4, MR. FUNG?
P_WITNESS: THAT IS NOT TRUE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU EACH OF THE ORIGINALS OF THIS CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST. I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THEM AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THE UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF EACH OF THE PAGES AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE--LET ME PUT IT IN ORDER FOR YOU. ONE OF THOSE PAGES DOESN'T HAVE STAPLE HOLES IN IT, MR. FUNG?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT IS PAGE 4, ISN'T IT?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The witness answered ""YES, IT IS"" when asked if page 4 is the one without staple holes. 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is directly agreeing with the question, so that's a clear commitment. Since it's a straightforward ""yes,"" it doesn't seem to be detrimental or beneficial to either side, just a neutral confirmation. So I'll go with a commitment level of 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is stating a fact about the document, which seems objective. There's no indication of deception here, so I'll mark it as truthful (1).

Consistency with previous testimony: The witness has been discussing the crime scene checklist and the handling of evidence. This response is consistent with the previous line of questioning about the documents, so it's consistent (0).

Response relevance: The question is about a specific page in the checklist, which is directly relevant to the case, especially regarding the handling of evidence and potential tampering. So, very relevant (1).

Response clarity: The answer is a simple ""yes,"" which is very clear. No hedging or ambiguity, so clarity is very clear (1).

Outcome of the turn: The questioner is trying to establish that the witness altered documents, which could impact the witness's credibility. By confirming that page 4 lacks staple holes, the witness is supporting the questioner's line of inquiry. So, the questioner wins this turn.

Reason for the outcome: The questioner is using logical arguments about the document's state to imply potential evidence tampering, which attacks the witness's credibility. So, the reason is logical arguments (1).

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes related to the case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper evidence collection procedures to avoid contamination and questioned the witness's reliability and accuracy in recounting the evidence collection process, particularly regarding Andrea Mazzola's role in swatching blood drops and the handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the accuracy of the witness's previous testimonies regarding Mazzola's training status and her role in collecting blood evidence. The defense suggested inconsistencies in the witness's statements about who primarily collected the blood samples, with the witness admitting that Mazzola did most of the work but hesitating to confirm that she did it exclusively.
   - The defense also raised concerns about the timing of the witness's arrival at the crime scenes and the potential for contamination due to delays in processing evidence, particularly regarding the handling of a blanket and the blood samples collected from the Bronco.
   - The witness's recollection of events and the procedures followed were challenged, particularly regarding the transfer of Mr. Simpson's blood vial and the labeling discrepancies in the evidence reports, leading to questions about the integrity of the evidence collection process. 

Overall, the defense aimed to highlight potential mishandling and contamination of evidence, while the witness attempted to defend the procedures followed during the investigation.

P_WITNESS: WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

DEFENSE: I'M REFERRING TO PAGE 4 OF THE CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST.
P_WITNESS: WHAT ABOUT IT?

DEFENSE: IF THERE WERE SOMETHING FILLED IN THERE THAT SAID 5:15 AS TO THE TIME LEAVING SCENE, THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU WROTE ON THE GRAY ENVELOPE YOU RECEIVED FROM DETECTIVE VANNATTER?
P_WITNESS: IF THERE WAS THAT TIME THERE, YES, IT WOULD.

DEFENSE: AND THAT IS WHY YOU DESTROYED THE ORIGINAL PAGE 4, MR. FUNG?
P_WITNESS: THAT IS NOT TRUE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU EACH OF THE ORIGINALS OF THIS CRIME SCENE CHECKLIST. I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THEM AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THE UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF EACH OF THE PAGES AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE--LET ME PUT IT IN ORDER FOR YOU. ONE OF THOSE PAGES DOESN'T HAVE STAPLE HOLES IN IT, MR. FUNG?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT IS PAGE 4, ISN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT IS.

DEFENSE: THAT IS BECAUSE THAT PAGE 4 IS NOT THE ORIGINAL PAGE 4?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether page 4 of the crime scene checklist is not the original because it lacks staple holes. The witness answered, ""THAT IS APPARENT TO ME NOW, YES.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is agreeing with the questioner's point, which seems to imply that the page was altered or replaced. This could be detrimental to the witness's credibility because it suggests they might have tampered with evidence. So, the commitment level is 1, detrimental.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is admitting that page 4 isn't the original, which could indicate they're being honest about it now. However, the fact that it's only apparent now might raise questions about why they didn't mention it before. I'm leaning towards 1, truthful, but there's some doubt.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness had to be shown videotapes to realize discrepancies, and now they're acknowledging another inconsistency. This seems inconsistent with their earlier statements, so consistency is 1, inconsistent.

Relevance: The question is directly about the authenticity of a document, which is very relevant to the case, especially regarding evidence handling. So, relevance is 1, very relevant.

Clarity: The response is straightforward and clear, without hedging. So, clarity is 1, very clear.

Outcome: The questioner is gaining the upper hand here because the witness is admitting a problem with the evidence documentation. So, the outcome favors the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The questioner used logical arguments to point out the inconsistency, which the witness had to concede. So, the reason is logical arguments.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized that the integrity of the crime scene was compromised due to improper handling and collection of evidence, particularly by Andrea Mazzola, who was alleged to have primarily collected blood samples. They argued that the procedures followed could lead to contamination and questioned the witness's reliability and accuracy in recounting events.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintained that he was present during the evidence collection and that he performed some functions himself, although he could not recall specifics. He acknowledged that Mazzola collected a significant portion of the blood samples but insisted that he acted under proper supervision and followed protocols.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's experience and role in collecting evidence, with the defense suggesting she was still in training while the witness claimed she was a criminalist. 
   - The defense questioned the witness's recollection of events, particularly regarding the collection of blood samples and the timeline of their arrival at the crime scenes, suggesting that delays and mishandling could have compromised evidence integrity.
   - The witness acknowledged potential issues with contamination, particularly concerning a blanket used at the crime scene, but the defense argued that the failure to analyze the blanket was a significant oversight.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's credibility by suggesting inconsistencies in his testimony about the handling of blood samples and the circumstances surrounding their collection, implying that he may have been trying to cover for other detectives involved in the case. 

Overall, the defense aimed to undermine the reliability of the evidence collected, while the witness defended the procedures followed during the investigation.

DEFENSE: HAVE YOU WATCHED ANY OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE TRIAL OF PRIOR WITNESSES?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was whether the witness had watched any of the testimony of prior witnesses, and the witness answered, ""YES, I HAVE."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a direct ""yes,"" which is a clear and firm answer. This seems like a beneficial commitment because it directly answers the question without hedging, so I'd rate it as a 2.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness's answer is straightforward. There's no obvious reason to doubt it, so I'll mark it as truthful with a 1.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, there's no prior information provided that contradicts this answer. So, it's consistent, rating it a 0.

The response is very relevant to the question asked. The defense is trying to establish if the witness has been influenced by prior testimony, so this is directly on point. Relevance is a 1.

Clarity-wise, the answer is very clear. It's a simple ""yes"" without any ambiguity, so clarity is a 1.

As for the outcome, the questioner gets the information they sought, so the outcome favors the questioner. The reason is that the answer is based on a logical and direct response, so the outcome reason is 1.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is clear, truthful, and directly answers the question, benefiting the questioner's line of inquiry.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: YES, I HAVE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU MAKE--DID YOU FORM ANY OPINION IN YOUR MIND AS TO WHAT KINDS OF ATTACKS WERE BEING MADE ON THE CREDIBILITY OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN?
","Okay, so I need to evaluate the witness's response based on the given properties. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, the witness's commitment level. The response is ""SEEMED TO ME THAT HIS OVERALL CREDIBILITY WAS BEING QUESTIONED."" This is a clear statement, so the commitment level is beneficial to the questioner because it acknowledges that Fuhrman's credibility was being attacked. So, I think it's a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is stating their perception, which seems honest. So, I'll rate it as 1, truthful.

Consistency with previous testimony. Earlier, the witness had some inconsistencies, especially about the blood vial handling. But this specific response doesn't contradict previous statements, so it's consistent. Therefore, 0.

Response relevance. The question was about whether the witness formed an opinion on attacks against Fuhrman. The answer directly addresses that, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

Response clarity. The answer is straightforward without hedging, so very clear. That's a 1.

Current turn outcome. The questioner gets a clear answer that supports their line of questioning, so the questioner wins this turn.

Reason for outcome. The witness provided a logical and clear answer that supports the questioner's point, so it's based on logical arguments. That's reason 1.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: SEEMED TO ME THAT HIS OVERALL CREDIBILITY WAS BEING QUESTIONED.

DEFENSE: HAVE YOU PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED THAT YOU WENT OUT TO INSPECT THE BRONCO THE MORNING OF YOUR TESTIMONY OF THE PRELIMINARY HEARING WHICH WAS JULY 6TH?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was whether the witness had previously testified that he went out to inspect the Bronco the morning of his testimony in the preliminary hearing, which was on July 6th. The witness answered ""YES.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness gave a direct ""YES,"" which is a clear and firm answer. This seems like a beneficial commitment because it directly addresses the question without hedging, so I think it's a level 2.

Next, regarding truthfulness, the witness has been consistent in his previous testimony about inspecting the Bronco on July 6th. There's no indication here that he's being untruthful, so I'll rate this as 1 for truthful.

Looking at consistency with previous testimony, the witness has mentioned this before, so it's consistent. Therefore, the consistency value is 0.

The response is very relevant to the question asked. The defense is trying to establish the witness's actions and credibility, so this is a key point. Relevance rate is 1.

Clarity-wise, the answer is straightforward and clear. There's no ambiguity, so manner rate is 1.

As for the outcome, the witness's clear and consistent answer supports his credibility, making the witness the winner of this turn. The reason is that his logical and consistent answer strengthens his position.

So, putting it all together, the witness's response is clear, consistent, and truthful, which makes him the winner in this exchange.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THEM AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THE UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF EACH OF THE PAGES AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE--LET ME PUT IT IN ORDER FOR YOU. ONE OF THOSE PAGES DOESN'T HAVE STAPLE HOLES IN IT, MR. FUNG?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT IS PAGE 4, ISN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: YES, IT IS.

DEFENSE: THAT IS BECAUSE THAT PAGE 4 IS NOT THE ORIGINAL PAGE 4?
P_WITNESS: THAT IS APPARENT TO ME NOW, YES.

DEFENSE: HAVE YOU WATCHED ANY OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE TRIAL OF PRIOR WITNESSES?
P_WITNESS: YES, I HAVE.

DEFENSE: DID YOU MAKE--DID YOU FORM ANY OPINION IN YOUR MIND AS TO WHAT KINDS OF ATTACKS WERE BEING MADE ON THE CREDIBILITY OF DETECTIVE FUHRMAN?
P_WITNESS: SEEMED TO ME THAT HIS OVERALL CREDIBILITY WAS BEING QUESTIONED.

DEFENSE: HAVE YOU PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED THAT YOU WENT OUT TO INSPECT THE BRONCO THE MORNING OF YOUR TESTIMONY OF THE PRELIMINARY HEARING WHICH WAS JULY 6TH?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: WERE YOU INFORMED BY MISS CLARK THAT A DETECTIVE HAD TESTIFIED TO SEEING RED STAINS ON THE DOOR SILL OF THE BRONCO?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness was informed by Miss Clark that a detective had testified to seeing red stains on the door sill of the Bronco. The witness answered, ""SHE HAD TOLD ME THAT A DETECTIVE HAD TOLD HER THAT STAINS WERE VISIBLE FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BRONCO.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is providing a specific statement about what Miss Clark told them, which seems to commit to the fact that they were informed about the detective's testimony. So, this is a beneficial commitment for the witness because it supports their narrative. I'll rate this as a 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is stating that Miss Clark informed them about the detective's testimony. There's no immediate indication that this is untruthful, so I'll consider this truthful, rating it a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness mentioned that they went to inspect the Bronco on July 6th and performed a presumptive test. This current statement aligns with that previous testimony, so it's consistent. I'll mark this as 0.

Response relevance: The answer directly addresses the question about whether Miss Clark informed them, making it very relevant. So, relevance is a 1.

Response clarity: The witness's answer is clear and straightforward without hedging, so clarity is a 1.

Outcome of the current turn: The witness provided a clear and consistent answer, which supports their position. Therefore, the outcome favors the witness.

Reason for the outcome: The witness's answer is based on logical and consistent information, so the reason is logical arguments being convincing, which is 1.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness seems to agree, so it's a beneficial commitment for the questioner, which would be level 2. 

Next, truthfulness. The answer seems truthful because it's a straightforward affirmation, so I'll rate it as 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Since the response is about a general fact regarding fibers and shoes, and there's no indication it contradicts earlier statements, I'll say it's consistent, so 0.

Relevance: The question is directly related to the topic of trace evidence and contamination, so it's very relevant, rating 1.

Clarity: The response is a bit hesitant with ""THEY HAVE A MORE--YES,"" which shows some hedging, so clarity is slightly clear, rating 2.

Outcome: The questioner benefits because the witness agreed, so the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The witness's agreement is based on logical arguments about trace evidence, so reason 1.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (P_Witness) presented conflicting claims regarding the collection and handling of evidence at the crime scenes.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper evidence collection procedures to avoid contamination, questioning the witness about the actions of Andrea Mazzola and the handling of blood samples. They suggested that Mazzola primarily collected the blood samples and that there were significant lapses in protocol that could have compromised the integrity of the evidence.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness acknowledged that Mazzola collected many blood samples but insisted that he also participated in the collection process. He maintained that the procedures followed were generally appropriate, although he admitted to some uncertainties regarding specific details.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the extent of Mazzola's training and her role in collecting evidence. The defense suggested that she was still in training during the critical evidence collection phases, while the witness claimed she was a criminalist and competent in her role.
   - The defense questioned the witness about the timing of his arrival at the crime scenes and the implications of delayed evidence collection, arguing that it could lead to contamination. The witness acknowledged the delays but defended the overall handling of the evidence.
   - The defense raised concerns about the potential for cross-contamination due to the handling of items like the blanket found at the crime scene, while the witness conceded that such risks existed but did not fully agree with the defense's implications of negligence.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's credibility regarding the handling of blood samples, suggesting inconsistencies in his testimony about how the blood was stored and transported, which the witness denied.

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant disputes over the procedures followed during the investigation and the reliability of the evidence collected, with the defense aiming to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the integrity of the evidence handling.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: YES.

DEFENSE: AND ASSUMING THAT BLANKET HAD HAIRS AND FIBERS AND OTHER TRACE EVIDENCE ON IT, THAT COULD BE A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF ANYTHING THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ON MR. GOLDMAN'S CLOTHING?
P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS MOVED, THEY COULD HAVEBECOME CONTAMINATED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY.

DEFENSE: IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF THAT BLANKET CONTAINED FIBERS THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENTWITH MR. SIMPSON'S BRONCO?
P_WITNESS: POSSIBLY, YES.

DEFENSE: BUT THAT BLANKET WAS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND NEVER PICKED UP FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS?
P_WITNESS: THAT'S CORRECT.

DEFENSE: THAT WAS A MISTAKE, WASN'T IT?
P_WITNESS: IT COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: SHE HAD TOLD ME THAT A DETECTIVE HAD TOLD HER THAT STAINS WERE VISIBLE FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BRONCO. *****

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU GAVE US TESTIMONY THAT THE FIBERS FROM A CARPET CAN GET INTO THE CREVICES OF SHOES?
P_WITNESS: THEY HAVE A MORE--YES.

DEFENSE: AND SO IF SOMEONE HAS STEPPED IN BLOOD AND THE SHOES ARE NO LONGER MAKING IMPRESSIONS OF BLOODY SHOEPRINTS ON CEMENT, WHEN A PERSON STEPS ON FIBERS, THE FIBERS WILL GO INTO THE CREVICES OF THE SHOE?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. The question was about whether fibers from a carpet can get into the crevices of shoes, especially after stepping in blood, and if those fibers can remain even when the shoes aren't leaving bloody prints anymore. The witness answered, ""IT'S POSSIBLE.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness says it's possible, which is a neutral statement. They're not fully committing to it being a definite fact, so I think the commitment level is neutral, which is a 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is a criminalist, so they should know about trace evidence. Fibers getting stuck in shoe crevices is a common concept, so I believe the answer is truthful. That's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness discussed how trace evidence like fibers and hairs can transfer and be sources of contamination. This answer aligns with that, so it's consistent. That's a 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about the fibers in shoes, which is very relevant to the case, especially regarding possible evidence contamination. So relevance is a 1.

Response clarity: The answer is straightforward and clear, just ""IT'S POSSIBLE."" No hedging or unclear language, so clarity is a 1.

Outcome: The questioner is trying to establish that fibers could transfer and remain, which supports their case. The witness's affirmation helps the questioner, so the outcome favors the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The witness's answer is based on logical, expert knowledge, making the argument convincing. So reason is 1.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the importance of proper evidence collection procedures to avoid contamination, questioning the witness about the actions of Andrea Mazzola and the handling of blood samples.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

P_WITNESS: SHE HAD TOLD ME THAT A DETECTIVE HAD TOLD HER THAT STAINS WERE VISIBLE FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE BRONCO. *****

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU GAVE US TESTIMONY THAT THE FIBERS FROM A CARPET CAN GET INTO THE CREVICES OF SHOES?
P_WITNESS: THEY HAVE A MORE--YES.

DEFENSE: AND SO IF SOMEONE HAS STEPPED IN BLOOD AND THE SHOES ARE NO LONGER MAKING IMPRESSIONS OF BLOODY SHOEPRINTS ON CEMENT, WHEN A PERSON STEPS ON FIBERS, THE FIBERS WILL GO INTO THE CREVICES OF THE SHOE?
P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: AND THAT WOULD BE TRUE FOR THE SHOES OF A POLICE OFFICER WHO HAD STEPPED IN BLOOD AS IT WOULD BE FOR ANY OTHER PERSON WEARING SHOES?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether fibers from a carpet can get into the crevices of shoes, similar to how a police officer's shoes might pick up fibers after stepping in blood. The witness answered, ""IF THAT WAS--YEAH. IT IS LIKELY.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness seems to agree, so it's a beneficial commitment for the questioner, which would be level 2. 

Next, truthfulness. The answer seems straightforward and honest, so I'll mark it as truthful (1).

Consistency with previous testimony: Earlier, the witness discussed how fibers and hairs can transfer, so this is consistent. Therefore, consistency is 0.

Response relevance: The answer directly addresses the question about fiber transfer, so it's very relevant (1).

Clarity: The response is a bit hesitant with the ""IF THAT WAS--YEAH,"" but overall, it's clear enough. I'll rate it as slightly clear with hedging (2).

Outcome: The questioner gets the benefit here because the witness agreed, so the outcome is in favor of the questioner.

Reason for outcome: The witness provided a logical agreement, so it's based on logical arguments (1).

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: NOW, YOU GAVE US TESTIMONY THAT THE FIBERS FROM A CARPET CAN GET INTO THE CREVICES OF SHOES?
P_WITNESS: THEY HAVE A MORE--YES.

P_WITNESS: IF THAT WAS--YEAH. IT IS LIKELY.

DEFENSE: NOW, THE MAT IN THE CAR, THE BRONCO, IT DOESN'T HAVE FIBERS?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the mat in the car, the Bronco, doesn't have fibers, and the witness answered ""NO."" 

First, I need to understand the context. The defense is questioning the witness about various aspects of crime scene contamination and evidence collection. The specific question here is about the Bronco's mat and whether it has fibers. The witness's answer is a simple ""NO,"" which I need to analyze based on the given properties.

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness answered ""NO,"" which is a direct response. However, it's a short answer without elaboration. It doesn't show a strong commitment either way. It's more of a neutral response, so I'd rate this as a 3 (Neutral commitment).

2. **Truthfulness**: Without more context, it's hard to say if the witness is being truthful. The answer is straightforward, but I don't have information on whether the Bronco's mat actually has fibers or not. So, I'll assume it's truthful unless proven otherwise, rating it as 1 (Truthful).

3. **Consistency with Previous Testimony**: Earlier, the witness discussed fibers and contamination, but there's no direct mention of the Bronco's mat. Since there's no prior statement on this specific point, I can't say it's inconsistent. So, it's consistent, rating 0.

4. **Response Relevance**: The question is about the Bronco's mat and fibers, which is relevant to the case as it pertains to possible evidence contamination or transfer. It's directly related, so I'll rate it as 1 (Very relevant).

5. **Response Clarity**: The answer is a simple ""NO,"" which is very clear. There's no ambiguity here, so it's 1 (Very clear).

6. **Current Turn Outcome**: The question is relevant and clear, but the answer doesn't provide new information. It's a straightforward denial, so the witness maintains their position without giving the questioner an advantage. So, the outcome is in favor of the Witness.

7. **Reasons for Outcome**: The witness's answer is clear and directly addresses the question without hesitation, making it convincing. So, the reason is 1 (Logical arguments are convincing).

Putting it all together, the witness's response is clear, relevant, and maintains their position without aiding the questioner's case.

P_WITNESS: IT'S POSSIBLE.

DEFENSE: IT WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE TO PUT THIS BLANKET FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THECRIME SCENE BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS OF CROSS CONTAMINATION OF HAIRS AND FIBERS?
P_WITNESS: DEPENDING ON THE -- HOW CLEAN THE BLANKET WAS, THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD AFFECT MY ANSWER.

DEFENSE: NOW, BASED ON YOUR OBSERVATIONS AT THE CRIME SCENE THAT DAY, MISS NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON'S BODY WAS IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

DEFENSE: AND MR. GOLDMAN'S BODY WAS EVENTUALLY PLACED IN THE AREA OF THAT BLANKET?

P_WITNESS: I BELIEVE THE CORONER'S PERSONNEL HAD PLACED A SHEET AND A PLASTIC SHEET OVER THE BLANKET BEFORE PLACINGHIM ON IT.

DEFENSE: ASSUMING THE BLANKET WAS COVERED WITH HAIRS AND FIBERS AND IT WAS PLACED IN THEMIDDLE OF THE CRIME SCENE AND HAIRS AND FIBERS FROM THE BLANKET WERE SPREAD OUT FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND ASSUMINGFURTHER THAT THE GLOVE OR THE HAT WAS DRAGGED INTO THAT AREA WHEN MR.

DEFENSE: MR. FUNG, WHEN DETECTIVE LANGE REQUESTED THAT YOU BRING THE GLOVE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEBUNDY CRIME SCENE TO SHOW IT TO HIM, YOU HAD CONCERNS THAT THERE WAS A TERRIBLE DANGER OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION?
P_WITNESS: I KNEW THERE WAS A DANGER FOR CROSS-CONTAMINATION, YES.

DEFENSE: WELL, ANOTHER THING ABOUT TRACE EVIDENCE IS THAT SOMETIMES IT BECOMES AIRBORNE?
P_WITNESS: SOMETIMES.

DEFENSE: HAIRS AND FIBERS THAT MAY GET ON CLOTHING OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE CAN BECOME AIRBORNE? THAT IS HOW THE TRANSFER OCCURS, RIGHT?
P_WITNESS: THEORETICALLY, YES. TRACE EVIDENCE IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH CONTACT, SUCH AS RUBBING ONE ITEM AGAINST ANOTHER. IT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH AIRBORNE.*****LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA; WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1995

DEFENSE: WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? HOW DID YOU GET IT TO THE CRIME SCENE TRUCK?

P_WITNESS: NO.

DEFENSE: YOU DID NOT SWATCH THE ITEMS THAT YOU SAW ON THE DOOR SILL?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. The question was about whether the witness swatched the items on the door sill, and the witness answered, ""THAT'S CORRECT."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is agreeing with the statement, which means they're confirming that they did not swatch the items. This seems like a clear commitment, so I think it's a 2 because it's a beneficial commitment for the witness as it clarifies their action.

Next, truthfulness. The witness has been consistent in their previous testimony about not swatching certain items, so I believe they're being truthful here. That's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony: The witness has mentioned before that they didn't swatch everything, so this is consistent. That's a 0.

Response relevance: The question is directly about their actions, so it's very relevant. That's a 1.

Response clarity: The answer is straightforward and clear, so that's a 1.

Outcome: The witness's clear and consistent answer helps their case, so the outcome is in favor of the witness.

Reason for outcome: The witness's answer is logical and consistent, making their position convincing. So, reason 1.
