#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:

In the court conversation, the defense is questioning Dr. Lee, a witness, about his involvement in identifying human remains in the continental United States. The defense highlights Dr. Lee's notable case, the People versus Crafts, where he was personally involved at the crime scene after the incident occurred. 

The important claim from the defense seems to be establishing Dr. Lee's credibility and expertise in forensic identification, particularly through his experience in a well-known case. 

The conflict or disagreement is not explicitly stated in this excerpt, but it can be inferred that the defense may be trying to counter any potential doubts about Dr. Lee's qualifications or the reliability of his findings in the current case by referencing his past work.

Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the important claims from each side are as follows:

1. **Defense Claim**: The defense is focusing on the specifics of the identification of human remains in the People versus Crafts case, emphasizing the challenges posed by the dispersion of biological evidence due to the victim's body being processed through a wood chipper. They highlight the significant area over which the evidence was spread, suggesting that this complicates the identification process.

2. **Witness Claim**: The witness, Dr. Lee, confirms the details of the case, including the method of disposal and the resultant scattering of biological evidence. He acknowledges that while some fragments were found, the majority of the remains likely ended up in the river, which supports the defense's assertion about the difficulties in evidence recovery.

**Conflicts and Disagreement**: The conversation does not explicitly present a conflict or disagreement at this moment; rather, it appears to be a line of questioning aimed at establishing the context and challenges related to the evidence in the Crafts case. The defense is attempting to clarify the circumstances surrounding the evidence, while the witness corroborates the defense's claims about the case's complexities.

D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the key claims from each side are as follows:

1. **Defense Claim**: The defense is focusing on the methodology used by Dr. Lee in the identification of human remains in the People versus Crafts case, emphasizing the challenges posed by the dispersion of biological evidence due to the victim's body being processed through a wood chipper. They highlight the process of collecting evidence from a large area and the techniques used to separate recognizable biological materials from debris.

2. **Witness Claim**: Dr. Lee, as the witness, confirms the details of the case and the methods employed in evidence collection. He acknowledges that while some recognizable materials were collected directly, other biological samples were mixed together and required a secondary procedure for identification.

**Conflicts and Disagreements**: The conversation does not present overt conflicts or disagreements but rather focuses on clarifying the procedures used in the evidence collection process. The defense seeks to ensure that the methods used by Dr. Lee were appropriate and effective, while Dr. Lee provides detailed explanations to support the validity of his work in the case. The underlying tension may stem from the defense's aim to question the reliability of the evidence due to the mixing of biological samples, which could impact the case's outcome.

In the court conversation, the defense is questioning Dr. Lee, a witness, about his involvement in the identification of human remains in a notable case, the People versus Crafts. 

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense emphasizes the complexity of the biological evidence collection process in the Crafts case, highlighting that the remains were dispersed over a large area due to the method of disposal (through a wood chipper) and that various biological samples, including human and animal remains, were mixed together during the collection process.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee confirms the defense's assertions, detailing the methods used to collect recognizable biological evidence and acknowledging that the collection process involved mixing different biological samples.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreement:**
   - There is an implicit conflict regarding the reliability of the biological evidence collected, as the defense suggests that the mixing of human remains with other biological materials could complicate the identification and analysis of the evidence. Dr. Lee's responses indicate an agreement with the defense's points, but the underlying concern about the integrity of the evidence remains a point of contention. The defense appears to be setting the stage to question the validity of the evidence linking the accused to the crime.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense is questioning Dr. Lee about his involvement in the People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was murdered by her husband, who disposed of her body using a wood chipper. 

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense emphasizes the complexity of the evidence collection process due to the biological remains being spread over a large area and mixed with other materials, including animal bones. They highlight that despite these challenges, Dr. Lee proceeded with DNA analysis on the evidence.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee confirms the defense's summary of the evidence collection process and acknowledges that while the biological samples were mixed, it was still appropriate to attempt DNA analysis.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreement:**
   - There is an implicit conflict regarding the reliability of the evidence collected, given the mixing of human remains with other biological materials. The defense seems to suggest that this could impact the integrity of the DNA analysis, while Dr. Lee maintains that the procedures followed were appropriate for the circumstances. The conversation indicates a disagreement on the implications of the evidence handling and its potential effects on the case's outcome.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is highlighting the methods used by Dr. Lee in the identification of human remains in the People versus Crafts case, emphasizing the challenges posed by the dispersion of biological evidence due to the victim's body being processed through a wood chipper. They assert that despite the mixing of human and animal biological samples, Dr. Lee proceeded with DNA analysis.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee confirms the defense's summary of the Crafts case and explains the procedures used to collect biological evidence, noting that recognizable materials were collected directly, while others were processed through melting snow to separate biological evidence from debris.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a conflict regarding the effectiveness of the DNA analysis conducted at the time of the Crafts case. The defense suggests that DNA technology was utilized despite the challenges, while Dr. Lee clarifies that while some DNA work was done, the technology available in the mid-eighties was limited, particularly in terms of comprehensive DNA profiling.
   - The defense appears to be questioning the reliability of the evidence collected due to the mixing of samples, while Dr. Lee maintains that the procedures followed were appropriate for the circumstances, indicating a disagreement on the validity of the evidence obtained.

2. **Witness Claim**: Dr. Lee, the witness, supports the defense's assertion by confirming that while the biological evidence was mixed with other materials, including animal remains, it was still possible to conduct DNA analysis to identify the human remains. He acknowledges the limitations of the technology available at the time but affirms that some DNA work was indeed performed.

**Conflicts and Disagreements**:
- There is a subtle conflict regarding the effectiveness of the DNA analysis given the mixed nature of the evidence. The defense suggests that the analysis was successful despite the challenges, while the witness acknowledges the difficulties but maintains that identification was still possible.
- Additionally, the defense raises the issue of budgetary constraints faced by criminalists, which could imply that financial limitations might affect the quality or thoroughness of forensic investigations. Dr. Lee agrees with this point, indicating a shared understanding of the challenges faced in forensic science.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasizes the challenges faced by forensic scientists, particularly regarding the identification of human remains in complex cases, such as the People versus Crafts case, where biological evidence was widely dispersed due to the method of body disposal. They highlight that despite the mixing of biological samples, DNA technology was still applied to identify human remains.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee confirms the defense's assertion about the Crafts case and acknowledges the difficulties in forensic science, including the mixing of human and animal biological samples. He also agrees that budgetary constraints limit the extent of forensic testing that can be conducted.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a subtle conflict regarding the effectiveness of forensic methods used in the past, particularly in the mid-eighties when DNA technology was not as advanced. The defense suggests that despite the challenges, proper identification was achieved, while Dr. Lee acknowledges the limitations of the technology at that time but confirms that some DNA work was done.
   - The discussion also touches on the broader issue of resource allocation in forensic science, with Dr. Lee agreeing that while some support exists, the reality is that not all desired tests can be performed due to financial constraints, indicating a systemic issue within forensic practices.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the challenges faced by forensic scientists, particularly regarding the identification of human remains in complex cases, such as the People versus Crafts case. They highlight the difficulties in collecting and analyzing biological evidence due to its dispersion and mixing with other materials.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee confirms the defense's assertions about the Crafts case, acknowledging that despite the mixed biological evidence, they were able to conduct some DNA analysis and identify human remains. He also agrees that forensic resources are often limited, which impacts the extent of testing that can be performed.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a subtle conflict regarding the effectiveness of the forensic methods used in the Crafts case. While the defense suggests that the mixing of biological samples complicates the analysis, Dr. Lee maintains that they were still able to achieve results despite these challenges.
   - The defense's line of questioning implies a critique of the forensic process and the limitations imposed by budgetary constraints, while Dr. Lee's responses indicate a defense of the methods used and the ability to work within those constraints, suggesting that with proper support, forensic scientists can still achieve meaningful results.

D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

Simpson murder trial, where he questioned the handling of blood evidence. His testimony was a turning point in the trial. ","PROSECUTION: Okay. Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

They highlight the case of People versus Crafts to illustrate how biological evidence can be mixed and still yield results, suggesting that the absence of certain evidence (like blood on a suspect) does not necessarily imply non-involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee supports the defense's assertion about the challenges in forensic science, acknowledging that while evidence can be mixed, it is still possible to identify human remains. He agrees with the general principle that absence of evidence does not equate to evidence of absence, but he also emphasizes that the context of each situation is crucial in making such determinations.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a nuanced disagreement regarding the interpretation of the absence of evidence. While Dr. Lee agrees with the general principle from Mr. MacDonnell's article, he points out that the specific examples may not universally apply, indicating that the context of each crime scene is critical in assessing involvement.
   - The defense and Dr. Lee also discuss the limitations of forensic testing due to budgetary constraints, with Dr. Lee acknowledging that while resources are scarce, the support from leadership can help mitigate some of these issues. This suggests a potential conflict between the ideal capabilities of forensic science and the practical limitations faced in real-world applications.

D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct.

D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and limitations of forensic evidence collection, particularly in the context of the People versus Crafts case, where biological evidence was mixed and scattered due to the method of body disposal. They argue that despite these challenges, DNA testing was attempted and yielded results, suggesting that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee supports the defense's assertion that forensic resources are often limited and that the absence of evidence does not equate to the absence of involvement in a crime. He acknowledges that various factors, including the nature of the crime scene and the distance from which a crime was committed, can affect the presence of blood spatter on a suspect.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a nuanced disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly the implications of ""absence of evidence."" While Dr. Lee generally agrees with the defense's position, he also emphasizes that the context of each situation is critical, indicating that conclusions cannot be universally applied.
   - The defense seeks to establish that forensic limitations and the nature of evidence collection can lead to misinterpretations about a suspect's involvement, while Dr. Lee acknowledges these limitations but insists that each case must be evaluated on its own merits, suggesting a more cautious approach to drawing conclusions from forensic evidence.

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and limitations of forensic evidence collection, particularly in cases where biological samples are mixed together. They highlight that despite these challenges, it is still possible to obtain useful DNA results, as demonstrated in the People versus Crafts case.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee acknowledges the difficulties faced by forensic scientists, including budgetary constraints and the variability of evidence collection. He agrees that the absence of blood on a suspect does not definitively indicate non-participation in a crime, as situational factors play a significant role.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreement:**
   - There is a nuanced disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly concerning the presence or absence of blood on a suspect. The defense suggests that forensic literature supports the idea that lack of blood does not imply lack of involvement, while Dr. Lee agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.
   - The defense seeks to establish that forensic science is not infallible and that conclusions drawn from evidence must consider the context, while Dr. Lee supports the notion that while evidence can be mixed and inconclusive, it can still yield valuable information when analyzed correctly. This indicates a broader conflict about the reliability and interpretation of forensic evidence in criminal cases.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness, Dr. Lee, discussed the identification of human remains in forensic cases, particularly referencing the People versus Crafts case. 

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense emphasized that despite the mixing of biological evidence from various sources (including human and animal remains), Dr. Lee and his team were able to conduct DNA testing and identify human remains in the Crafts case. They also highlighted the practical challenges forensic scientists face, such as budgetary constraints that limit the extent of testing that can be performed.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee acknowledged the challenges in forensic science, agreeing that while absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime, the context of each situation is crucial. He noted that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect's clothing can vary significantly depending on the circumstances of the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly the idea that a lack of blood on a suspect does not necessarily mean they did not participate in a violent crime. Dr. Lee pointed out that while this is generally true, it is highly situational and depends on the specifics of the crime scene.
   - The defense sought to establish that forensic limitations and the mixing of evidence do not preclude the possibility of identifying human remains, while Dr. Lee emphasized the variability and context-dependent nature of forensic evidence interpretation, suggesting that conclusions cannot be universally applied without considering the specifics of each case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?

Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and limitations of forensic evidence collection, particularly in cases where biological samples are mixed together. They highlight that despite the challenges, DNA technology was still applied in the past, even when evidence was not pristine.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee acknowledges the difficulties faced by forensic scientists, including budgetary constraints and the variability of evidence collection. He agrees that the absence of blood on a suspect does not definitively indicate non-participation in a crime, as situational factors can influence the presence of blood spatter.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly concerning the implications of not finding blood on a suspect. The defense argues that absence of blood does not equate to absence of involvement in a crime, while Dr. Lee supports this notion but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.
   - The defense also seeks to clarify the methodology used in past cases, particularly the Crafts case, and how mixed biological evidence was handled. Dr. Lee confirms that while some evidence was mixed, they were still able to identify human remains, which the defense uses to argue for the reliability of forensic methods despite challenges. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the complexities of forensic science and the nuances involved in interpreting evidence in criminal cases.

The defense argues that one cannot conclude that a suspect did not participate in a crime simply because they lack blood on them, while Dr. Lee agrees in general but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.
   - **Expectations of Blood Evidence:** The defense and Dr. Lee discuss the expectations of finding blood on a suspect's clothing in various scenarios. Dr. Lee indicates that while one would generally expect to find blood in a bloody crime scene, the actual presence of blood on a suspect can vary significantly based on factors such as the distance from the victim and the nature of the crime (e.g., shooting versus stabbing). This highlights a nuanced disagreement about the interpretation of forensic evidence in relation to the suspect's involvement in the crime.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

Simpson murder trial, where he questioned the handling of blood evidence. His testimony was a turning point in the trial. ","PROSECUTION: Okay.

D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and limitations of forensic evidence collection, particularly in cases where biological samples are mixed and the challenges posed by budgetary constraints in forensic science. They are also highlighting the idea that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee, the forensic expert, acknowledges the challenges in forensic science, including the mixing of biological samples and the limitations of technology at the time of the Crafts case. He agrees that the absence of blood does not definitively prove a suspect's non-involvement, but he also emphasizes that the context of the crime scene is crucial in determining expectations for blood evidence.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly concerning the implications of not finding blood on a suspect. The defense suggests that this absence does not rule out involvement, while Dr. Lee agrees but insists that the situation must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
   - The defense is trying to establish that forensic scientists often face limitations that can affect their conclusions, while Dr. Lee acknowledges these limitations but also stresses the importance of context in forensic analysis, indicating that not all scenarios are the same.
   - The defense's questioning implies a critique of the forensic methods used in past cases, while Dr. Lee defends the validity of the methods employed, even when faced with mixed biological evidence.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and limitations of forensic evidence collection, particularly in cases where biological samples are mixed together. They highlight the challenges forensic scientists face, such as budgetary constraints and the inability to conduct exhaustive testing on all evidence.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee, the forensic witness, acknowledges the difficulties in forensic science but asserts that it is still possible to obtain valuable results from mixed biological evidence, as demonstrated in the People versus Crafts case. He also agrees with the general principle that the absence of blood on a suspect does not definitively indicate non-participation in a crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly in relation to blood spatter and the implications of not finding blood on a suspect. The defense suggests that forensic literature supports the idea that lack of blood does not rule out involvement in a crime, while Dr. Lee agrees but emphasizes that the context of each situation is crucial.
   - The defense also questions Dr. Lee about specific cases, such as People versus Hoeplinger, where the details of the crime scene and the suspect's actions are contested. Dr. Lee corrects the defense's account of the events, indicating a conflict in the understanding of the case details.

Overall, the conversation highlights the complexities of forensic science and the differing interpretations of evidence in criminal cases.

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

Simpson murder trial, where he questioned the handling of blood evidence. His testimony was a turning point in the trial. ","PROSECUTION: Okay. Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

   - There is a disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly concerning the implications of not finding blood on a suspect. While the defense argues that this absence does not imply non-involvement, Dr. Lee acknowledges that it depends on the specific circumstances of the crime scene, suggesting a nuanced view rather than a blanket statement.
   - The defense and Dr. Lee also discuss specific cases, such as the People versus Crafts and People versus Hoeplinger, where the nature of the crime and the resulting blood evidence are examined. Dr. Lee's recollection of the details in these cases sometimes differs from the defense's framing, indicating potential conflicts in how the evidence and circumstances are understood.

D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness, Dr. Lee, presented the following important claims and conflicts:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the challenges forensic scientists face, particularly regarding the limitations of evidence collection and the interpretation of blood evidence. They argue that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime, as various factors can influence blood spatter and evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee supports the defense's assertion that forensic science literature cautions against inferring non-participation based solely on the absence of blood. He acknowledges that the context of the crime scene, such as distance and the nature of the assault, plays a crucial role in determining whether blood would be found on a suspect.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the specifics of evidence collection and the interpretation of blood evidence in different scenarios. The defense highlights that in some cases, like the Hoeplinger case, despite a bloody crime scene, the suspect had minimal blood on their clothing, which raises questions about the reliability of blood evidence as an indicator of guilt.
   - Dr. Lee agrees with the defense's general points but also emphasizes that the situation's specifics can lead to different outcomes regarding blood spatter and evidence presence. He notes that while more blood typically leads to more blood on the suspect, various factors can alter this expectation, indicating a nuanced understanding of forensic evidence that may not align perfectly with the defense's broader claims.

Simpson murder trial, where he questioned the handling of blood evidence. His testimony was a turning point in the trial. ","PROSECUTION: Okay. Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the challenges forensic scientists face, particularly regarding the limitations of evidence collection and the interpretation of blood evidence. They argue that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime, as various factors can influence blood spatter and evidence collection.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee, the forensic witness, supports the defense's assertion that the absence of blood does not definitively prove a lack of involvement in a crime. He acknowledges that the context of the crime scene, the distance from the victim, and the nature of the assault can all affect whether a suspect would have blood on them.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the specifics of evidence collection and the interpretation of mixed biological samples. The defense questions the reliability of the evidence collected in the past, particularly in the People versus Crafts case, where biological evidence was mixed with other materials.
   - The defense also challenges Dr. Lee's recollection of the People versus Hoeplinger case, particularly regarding the amount of blood found on the suspect's clothing. Dr. Lee confirms that there were only two drops of blood on the suspect's jeans, which raises questions about the suspect's involvement given the violent nature of the crime.
   - Additionally, there is a nuanced discussion about the variability of blood spatter evidence based on the circumstances of the crime, with Dr. Lee indicating that while more blood is generally expected in close-contact situations, there are exceptions based on the specifics of each case. This highlights the complexity and potential for differing interpretations in forensic science.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that that kind of an assault with the brick on the head by beating numerous times produces enormous amount of blood and it did so in the Hoeplinger case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that on the suspect's jeans, there were only two drops of blood?
D_WITNESS: Well, we assume that's the original jean. I don't have any record, but I do know he wash his T-shirt. I found a T-shirt washed in the pond.

PROSECUTION: Right.
D_WITNESS: But the blue jean, whether or not that's the original blue jean, I have no or information, record of it.

PROSECUTION: Well, you testified in court and those blue jeans were presented to a jury as being worn by the suspects--suspect, the husband at the time of the murder; is that correct?

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the following key claims and conflicts emerged from both sides:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and limitations of forensic evidence, particularly in relation to blood spatter and the identification of human remains. They argue that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime, as various factors can influence blood spatter patterns.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee, the forensic witness, supports the defense's assertion that forensic science is not absolute and that the presence or absence of blood can depend on numerous situational factors. He acknowledges that while he has encountered cases with significant bloodshed, the results can vary based on the circumstances of the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the interpretation of forensic evidence, particularly in the context of the People versus Hoeplinger case. The defense points out that despite a violent crime resulting in a lot of blood, the suspect's jeans had only two drops of blood, which raises questions about the reliability of the evidence presented.
   - Dr. Lee's recollection of the specifics of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the defense, who seeks to clarify the details of the evidence and the suspect's actions. Dr. Lee admits to some uncertainty about the specifics, indicating that he has worked on many cases over the years.
   - The defense also highlights the practical limitations of forensic science, such as budgetary constraints and the inability to conduct exhaustive testing in every case, which Dr. Lee agrees with, further complicating the reliability of forensic conclusions.

The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness, Dr. Lee, discussed the identification of human remains in forensic cases, particularly referencing the People versus Crafts case and the People versus Hoeplinger case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense emphasized the challenges forensic scientists face, such as budgetary constraints and the complexities of collecting and analyzing biological evidence, especially when it is mixed with other materials. They highlighted that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime.
   - **Witness Claim (Dr. Lee):** Dr. Lee acknowledged the difficulties in forensic science, agreeing that while it is possible to identify human remains even when biological evidence is mixed, the context of each case is crucial. He also confirmed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect's clothing can vary significantly based on the circumstances of the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement regarding the implications of the absence of blood on a suspect. The defense argued that it cannot be conclusively inferred that a suspect did not participate in a crime solely based on a lack of blood evidence, while Dr. Lee supported this notion but emphasized that it depends on the specific situation of the crime.
   - The defense also questioned the reliability of evidence from the Hoeplinger case, where the suspect had minimal blood on his jeans despite a violent crime. Dr. Lee's recollection of the case was somewhat vague, leading to uncertainty about the evidence presented in court, which the defense used to challenge the credibility of the forensic findings.

Recent Exchanges:
PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that that kind of an assault with the brick on the head by beating numerous times produces enormous amount of blood and it did so in the Hoeplinger case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that on the suspect's jeans, there were only two drops of blood?
D_WITNESS: Well, we assume that's the original jean. I don't have any record, but I do know he wash his T-shirt. I found a T-shirt washed in the pond.

PROSECUTION: Right.
D_WITNESS: But the blue jean, whether or not that's the original blue jean, I have no or information, record of it.

PROSECUTION: Well, you testified in court and those blue jeans were presented to a jury as being worn by the suspects--suspect, the husband at the time of the murder; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I--that's long time ago. If you say correct, probably correct. I don't recall. There's thousands cases I been working on.

PROSECUTION: Does that seem to be consistent with your memory?
D_WITNESS: Sure. Sure.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: And only two blood drops?
D_WITNESS: I don't remember. If you say two drops, it's two drop.",simpson_defense_6,Dr. Henry Lee,"Dr. Henry Lee was a forensic scientist who testified for the defense in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, where he questioned the handling of blood evidence. His testimony was a turning point in the trial. ","PROSECUTION: Okay. Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

36,36,1483,1483,1483,Q/A,"And the scene was covered in blood, correct?",Yes.,,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"### Summary of Facts Discussed in the Dialogue

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness, Dr. Lee, presented the following important claims and conflicts:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense is emphasizing the complexities and challenges forensic scientists face in identifying biological evidence, particularly in cases where evidence is mixed and scattered, as illustrated by the People versus Crafts case. They argue that despite these challenges, DNA technology was still applied to the evidence collected.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee supports the defense's assertion by confirming that while the biological evidence was mixed, it was still possible to identify human remains using the available technology at the time. He also acknowledges the limitations of forensic resources and the variability in blood spatter evidence based on the circumstances of a crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - **Identification of Evidence:** There is a conflict regarding the reliability of evidence collected from crime scenes where biological materials are mixed. The defense suggests that the presence of mixed evidence does not preclude the possibility of identifying human remains, while Dr. Lee agrees but emphasizes that the context of each case is crucial.
   - **Blood Evidence in Crimes:** The defense questions the expectation of finding blood on a suspect's clothing after a violent crime, citing specific cases (like People versus Hoeplinger) where the suspect had minimal blood on their clothing despite a bloody crime scene. Dr. Lee agrees that the amount of blood found on a suspect can vary significantly based on the circumstances of the crime, indicating a nuanced understanding rather than a straightforward correlation.
   - **Memory and Testimony Consistency:** The defense challenges Dr. Lee's recollection of specific details from past cases, particularly regarding the amount of blood found on the suspect's jeans in the Hoeplinger case. Dr. Lee's responses suggest uncertainty, which the defense uses to question the reliability of forensic evidence presented in court. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the complexities of forensic science, the challenges of evidence collection, and the variability of blood spatter evidence in violent crimes, while also revealing tensions between the defense's narrative and the witness's recollections.

#### 1. **Identification of Human Remains**
   - **Case Reference**: The People versus Crafts case, where the victim, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and disposed of using a wood chipper.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Biological evidence was spread over a large area (2500 square feet) and involved melting snow to collect evidence.
   - **Mixing of Evidence**: Biological samples were mixed with other materials, including deer bones, during collection.

#### 2. **Forensic Technology and Limitations**
   - **DNA Testing**: At the time of the Crafts case (mid-1980s), DNA technology was limited, but some identification was possible (e.g., determining male or female).
   - **Resource Constraints**: Forensic scientists face budgetary issues that limit the extent of testing and analysis that can be performed.

#### 3. **Absence of Evidence**
   - **MacDonnell's Article**: The concept that absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation in a crime was discussed.
   - **Contextual Factors**: The witness agreed that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on various situational factors (e.g., distance from the crime, type of weapon used).

#### 4. **Specific Cases and Blood Evidence**
   - **People versus Hoeplinger**: A case where a husband beat his wife to death with a brick, resulting in a bloody crime scene.
   - **Blood Evidence on Suspect**: Despite the bloody scene, only two drops of blood were found on the suspect's jeans, raising questions about the evidence's reliability.

### Conflicts and Disagreements

1. **Evidence Collection Methodology**:
   - **Prosecution's Position**: The Prosecution emphasizes the potential for contamination and mixing of biological samples during evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Position**: The witness acknowledges the mixing but maintains that recognizable evidence was properly collected.

2. **Interpretation of Absence of Blood**:
   - **Prosecution's Argument**: The Prosecution argues that absence of blood on a suspect does not rule out their involvement in a crime.
   - **Witness's Agreement**: The witness agrees but emphasizes that it depends on the specific circumstances of each case.

3. **Specific Case Details**:
   - **Disagreement on Details**: The witness's recollection of the Hoeplinger case is challenged by the Prosecution, particularly regarding the blood evidence found on the suspect's clothing.
   - **Witness's Memory**: The witness admits to not recalling every detail but generally agrees with the Prosecution's assertions about the case.

### Conclusion
The dialogue highlights the complexities of forensic evidence collection and analysis, the limitations of technology at the time of the cases discussed, and the nuanced understanding of how absence of evidence can be interpreted in the context of criminal investigations. Conflicts arise primarily from differing interpretations of evidence and recollections of specific case details.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness, Dr. Lee, discussed the identification of human remains in forensic cases, particularly referencing the People versus Crafts case and the People versus Hoeplinger case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense emphasized the challenges forensic scientists face, such as budgetary constraints and the complexities of evidence collection, particularly when biological samples are mixed together. They highlighted that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee acknowledged the difficulties in forensic science, agreeing that while absence of evidence does not imply absence of participation, the presence of blood on a suspect can vary significantly based on the circumstances of the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement regarding the implications of blood evidence. The defense argued that forensic literature cautions against inferring non-participation based solely on the absence of blood, while Dr. Lee agreed but noted that the context of the crime (e.g., distance from the victim) is crucial in determining whether blood should be expected on a suspect.
   - In the Hoeplinger case, the defense pointed out that despite a bloody crime scene, the suspect had only two drops of blood on his jeans, which seemed inconsistent with the violent nature of the crime. Dr. Lee acknowledged the bloodiness of the scene but expressed uncertainty about the jeans' provenance, indicating a lack of definitive evidence regarding their condition at the time of the murder.

Recent Exchanges:
PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that that kind of an assault with the brick on the head by beating numerous times produces enormous amount of blood and it did so in the Hoeplinger case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that on the suspect's jeans, there were only two drops of blood?
D_WITNESS: Well, we assume that's the original jean. I don't have any record, but I do know he wash his T-shirt. I found a T-shirt washed in the pond.

PROSECUTION: Right.
D_WITNESS: But the blue jean, whether or not that's the original blue jean, I have no or information, record of it.

PROSECUTION: Well, you testified in court and those blue jeans were presented to a jury as being worn by the suspects--suspect, the husband at the time of the murder; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I--that's long time ago. If you say correct, probably correct. I don't recall. There's thousands cases I been working on.

PROSECUTION: Does that seem to be consistent with your memory?
D_WITNESS: Sure. Sure.

PROSECUTION: And only two blood drops?
D_WITNESS: I don't remember. If you say two drops, it's two drop.

PROSECUTION: Sir, if a person were to wrap their hand around someone's throat and slit that person's throat--
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.",simpson_defense_6,Dr. Henry Lee,"Dr. Henry Lee was a forensic scientist who testified for the defense in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, where he questioned the handling of blood evidence. His testimony was a turning point in the trial. ","PROSECUTION: Okay. Now, Dr. Lee, I wanted to just mention very briefly or ask you very briefly about one of the matters that you just alluded to a few moments ago.
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Regarding identification of human remains in cases here in the continental United States.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Your most famous such case where you were personally involved at the crime scene, not at the time of the crime, but afterwards.
D_WITNESS: Thank you very much.

PROSECUTION: Yes.--was the People versus Crafts case; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And was that a case, sir, where the victim in that case, Helen Crafts, was killed by her husband and she was--he disposed of her by putting her body through a wood chipper machine?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And in that particular case is it a fair summary of what happened that the biological evidence was spread over a very significant amount of territory, about 2500 square feet, in the snow by a river as a result of the body having gone through the wood clipper machine?
D_WITNESS: The majority this and probably wound up in the river. Only small fragment were found scattered around the river bank.

PROSECUTION: Right. And just so it is clear, what was done in this case is large amounts of snow were put in buckets and then taken into tents and melted and the biological evidence would tend to fall or sink to the bottom of the bucket and all the debris would tend to rise to the top and you just throw the debris out and take the biological evidence out in the bottom?
D_WITNESS: Not exactly. Any recognizable material, for example, we found a fingernail, you can recognize, you don't have to throw in a bucket. You just taken it out. If it is bone chips, we can recognize, or a tooth. We have a team of scientists, team of investigator work together since we can see and recognizable right away, you remove it. For example, I can see a scissor, I collect a scissor. I don't have to throw the scissor in the bucket. Things we cannot visually recognize, we use the second procedure.

PROSECUTION: And that included some of the biological evidence in the case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And Dr. Lee, when that occurred, when the items would fall to the bottom of the bucket, various different biological samples could get mixed together or were mixed together; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, yes.

PROSECUTION: And it also mixed together human biological samples with others that were out there, like deer bones and the like; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, correct.

PROSECUTION: Yes. And despite that, sir, it was proper and you did decide to attempt DNA technology on this evidence; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: All right. But this case was a little while ago, as I recall, it was in the mid-eighties?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So with the state of the technology at that time, you were not actually able to do DNA, true?
D_WITNESS: No. We did some DNA work.

PROSECUTION: Oh, you did?
D_WITNESS: We did some X, Y, determine male, female.

PROSECUTION: Okay. You were also able to do--when I say ""You"" I'm also including your laboratory people--
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. And you were able to get results that identified the human remains in that case even though all the biological evidence was mixed together at the time that it was collected?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Do you agree, sir, that one of the practical realities that criminalists face who are working for law enforcement, is budgetary problems and monetary shortfalls?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So would you agree, sir, that generally speaking, forensic resources are scarce in the sense that we can't do all the testing and all the study in every case that we would like to do?
D_WITNESS: That is absolute correct. Of course if you have the support of the leadership, for example, I have a good boss, my commissioner very supportive to forensic science, so we try to do what supposed to do. Of course impossible to do every possible test in this earth for a certain case.

PROSECUTION: Okay. All right. Have you read Mr. MacDonnell's article on the ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: (No audible response.)

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness, Dr. Lee, discussed forensic evidence related to two specific cases: the People versus Crafts and the People versus Hoeplinger.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense emphasized the challenges forensic scientists face, particularly regarding the mixing of biological evidence and the limitations of forensic resources. They highlighted that the absence of blood on a suspect does not necessarily indicate non-participation in a crime, as various factors can influence blood spatter and evidence collection.
   - **Witness's Claim:** Dr. Lee acknowledged the complexities of forensic science, agreeing that the presence or absence of blood on a suspect can depend on numerous situational factors, including the nature of the crime and the distance from the victim. He confirmed that in some cases, even with significant bloodshed, a suspect may not have blood on their clothing.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement regarding the implications of blood evidence. The defense argued that forensic literature cautions against inferring a suspect's non-involvement based solely on the absence of blood, while Dr. Lee agreed but noted that it varies by situation.
   - The defense also pointed out inconsistencies in the Hoeplinger case, where a significant amount of blood was present at the crime scene, yet only two drops were found on the suspect's jeans. Dr. Lee acknowledged the blood presence but could not definitively confirm the details of the jeans' evidence due to the passage of time and the volume of cases he has handled.
   - The defense's line of questioning suggested that the forensic evidence could be interpreted in a way that supports their argument, while Dr. Lee maintained that the interpretation of evidence is highly contextual and dependent on specific circumstances of each case.

PROSECUTION: ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence""?
D_WITNESS: I'm a Chinese. Take me a while to think about this double-talk. Absence--

PROSECUTION: And do you agree generally with the findings of MacDonnell in this particular article?
D_WITNESS: In general, yes, but the specific example he give maybe not totally cover the whole situation.

PROSECUTION: Okay. But in general do you agree with the proposition that we really can't infer that someone cannot participate in a crime involving a bloody event simply because they don't have blood on them, on their clothing or on their person?
D_WITNESS: Again, as I indicate before, depend on situation. One example said beat up a rabbit. Rabbit, human two different scene. You beat up a rabbit, did not get blood spatter on your clothing. Doesn't mean you beat up a human did not get blood on your body, and I guess depends on situation. If you standing a distance, firing a shot, gunshot, thirty feet away, kill somebody, I don't expect to find blood spatter on somebody's clothing. That is correct. However, if you put the gun next to somebody's head, fire a shot, nothing, no clothing, block the back spatter, I expect to find some blood spatter, so it varies. I cannot in certain senses, correct. In other situation maybe not.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Isn't there a lot of forensic science literature out there that generally cautions the forensic scientists who are involved in blood spatter that you can't really say that someone didn't participate in a crime just because they are not covered in blood even if it is something like a stabbing?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, sir, have you had some cases yourself in your own career as a forensic scientist where the crime scene was extremely bloody?
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: Yet--yet the suspect did not have a lot of blood on his clothing?
D_WITNESS: Off my head I don't really remember every crime scene I went. In general more blood, I should expect to find some blood on the suspect. Again, depends on situation. You have a shooting at a distance, yes, the victim lying there, have a lot of blood. Suspect with a long gun, you don't expect to find that. Those are correct. If a closed compact situation, maybe different.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, let's get to one of your comments about in theory, there should be some blood in response to Mr. Scheck's line of questioning.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Remember that?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Okay. Would that also depend upon where the suspect was standing?
D_WITNESS: Uh, depends on whether or not a combat situation, hand-to-hand combat situation. You have distance, of course, the chances for getting blood on unless some material spurt or certain force, internal force or external force. You have injury on the hand, have a cast off, have other motion, that going to cast to greater distance. If in close contact, if large amount of blood come out, you going to have more blood.

PROSECUTION: Let me ask you this, doctor. Do you recall one of your fairly well known cases back in 1984 by the name of People versus Hoeplinger where a husband beat his wife to death by hitting her numerous times in the head with a brick, drug her body out to a fish pond, drug her back into the house and then claimed that someone else broke into the home and committed the murder?
D_WITNESS: 80 percent correct. Not drag to the fish pond. Never got to the fish pond.

PROSECUTION: Only part way?
D_WITNESS: Drug, carry to a location end of the driveway and drag into a pack of Sandril (Sic) to--near the neighbor's house and carry the body, half drug, half carry, put back in family room on the sofa.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that that kind of an assault with the brick on the head by beating numerous times produces enormous amount of blood and it did so in the Hoeplinger case?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And isn't it true that on the suspect's jeans, there were only two drops of blood?
D_WITNESS: Well, we assume that's the original jean. I don't have any record, but I do know he wash his T-shirt. I found a T-shirt washed in the pond.

PROSECUTION: Right.
D_WITNESS: But the blue jean, whether or not that's the original blue jean, I have no or information, record of it.

PROSECUTION: Well, you testified in court and those blue jeans were presented to a jury as being worn by the suspects--suspect, the husband at the time of the murder; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I--that's long time ago. If you say correct, probably correct. I don't recall. There's thousands cases I been working on.

PROSECUTION: Does that seem to be consistent with your memory?
D_WITNESS: Sure. Sure.

PROSECUTION: And only two blood drops?
D_WITNESS: I don't remember. If you say two drops, it's two drop.

PROSECUTION: And the scene was covered in blood, correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: Sir, if a person were to wrap their hand around someone's throat and slit that person's throat--
D_WITNESS: Yes, sir.

PROSECUTION: --and the blood spurted forward, would you expect the assailant to be covered in blood?

Explanation:
- **Commitment_value**: The witness's response is neutral, neither strongly benefiting the questioner nor the witness.
- **quality_rate**: The witness appears to be truthful in their response.
- **consistency_value**: The response is consistent with the witness's previous testimony and the principles of blood spatter analysis.
- **relevance_rate**: The response is very relevant to the question asked.
- **manner_rate**: The response is slightly clear but includes hedging (""Probably not""), indicating some uncertainty.
- **outcome_value**: The witness is the outcome of the current turn because the response does not significantly weaken the witness's position.
- **outcome_reason**: The response does not provide a strong credibility attack on the other side, but it maintains the witness's credibility by acknowledging the variability in blood spatter scenarios.","The witness's response is neutral and slightly unclear, but it does not provide a strong advantage to either side.
