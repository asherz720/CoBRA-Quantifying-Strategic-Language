The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:

The defense suggests that the witness's later additions to the report may undermine its credibility, while the witness maintains that the standard practice is to trust patient history. This disagreement centers on the accuracy and completeness of the medical documentation related to Mr. Simpson's condition.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**

D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the key claims and conflicts from both sides are as follows:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is questioning the credibility and thoroughness of the witness's examination of Mr. Simpson. They highlight that the witness has no notes from the initial examination and that certain observations, such as Mr. Simpson's gait, were not included in the report but were later added. The defense suggests that the witness may have relied too heavily on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms without independent verification.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintains that their report is based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and their own observations. They acknowledge the possibility that Mr. Simpson could have had a motive to misrepresent his symptoms but assert that their evaluation was conducted based on the information available at the time.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a clear conflict regarding the reliability of the witness's examination and report. The defense argues that the lack of notes and the absence of certain observations in the report undermine the witness's conclusions about Mr. Simpson's condition.
   - The defense also challenges the witness's assumption that patients are generally truthful, suggesting that Mr. Simpson may not have been candid. The witness, while acknowledging the possibility of dishonesty, defends their methodology and the basis of their report.
   - Additionally, the defense points out that the witness had an opportunity for further examination after the initial assessment but did not find any significant issues, such as enlarged lymph nodes, which could impact the credibility of the witness's findings.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present their important claims and highlight their conflicts:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately document or conduct a thorough examination of Mr. Simpson, suggesting that the doctor's report lacks critical observations and tests that could have been performed. They emphasize that the doctor relied heavily on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms without independent verification.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The doctor maintains that his report is based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations during the examination. He acknowledges that while he considered the possibility of Mr. Simpson not being truthful, he did not find any physical evidence to contradict the patient's claims during the examination.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and the absence of specific tests, such as the grip strength test, which they argue could have provided valuable information regarding Mr. Simpson's condition. The doctor admits that while he could have performed the grip test, it was not typical for the examination conducted.
   - There is a disagreement over the reliability of the patient's self-reported symptoms. The defense suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to misrepresent his condition, while the doctor insists that he based his findings on the information provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations, without any independent basis to assess the patient's honesty.

D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately document or conduct necessary tests during his examination of Mr. Simpson on June 15th, suggesting that the doctor relied too heavily on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms without independent verification. They emphasize that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there was no evidence of an acute arthritic problem at that time.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his report was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He acknowledges that while he did not find evidence of an acute issue, he did not rule out the possibility of chronic conditions.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and the absence of specific tests, such as a grip strength test, which they argue could have provided more insight into Mr. Simpson's condition. The doctor counters that the tests were not typical for the examination and that he based his conclusions on the information available to him.
   - There is a disagreement regarding the necessity of further orthopedic evaluation and the nature of Mr. Simpson's arthritic condition. The defense asserts that the doctor did not find any acute issues, while the doctor disputes this claim, indicating that there were indeed concerns that warranted attention.

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented important claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately document or evaluate Mr. Simpson's condition during the examination on June 15th, suggesting that the doctor's conclusions may be based on incomplete or unreliable information provided by Mr. Simpson.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his report is based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations, asserting that he did not find evidence of an acute arthritic problem or any physical limitations that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the credibility of the doctor's findings, highlighting the absence of specific observations in the report, such as Mr. Simpson's gait and the results of a grip strength test. The defense suggests that the doctor had opportunities to conduct further examinations but did not do so.
   - The witness disagrees with the defense's interpretation of his findings, asserting that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic rather than acute. The doctor also refutes the defense's claim that he found no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, indicating a disagreement on the nature of Mr. Simpson's medical condition.
   - Additionally, the defense raises the possibility that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to mislead the doctor about his symptoms, while the witness acknowledges the potential for patients to be less than candid but insists that his evaluation was thorough based on the information available to him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is questioning the credibility and thoroughness of the doctor's examination of Mr. Simpson, emphasizing that the doctor did not document certain observations or conduct specific tests that could have been relevant to Mr. Simpson's condition. They argue that the doctor relied too heavily on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history without independent verification.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his report is based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there was no evidence of an acute arthritic problem during the examination on June 15th.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenges the doctor's lack of notes and the absence of certain findings in his report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and the need for further examination. They argue that the doctor should have considered the possibility that Mr. Simpson might not have been truthful about his symptoms.
   - The witness disagrees with the defense's interpretation of his findings, insisting that he did not find any acute issues that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime. The defense also questions the doctor's methods and whether he conducted all appropriate tests, such as the grip strength test, which the doctor claims was not typical for the examination conducted. 
   - Additionally, there is a disagreement about the nature of injuries that could be caused by a knife versus glass, with the doctor acknowledging that both types of injuries can mimic each other, which the defense uses to cast doubt on the doctor's conclusions.

D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the key claims and conflicts from both sides are as follows:

1. **Defense's Important Claims:**
   - The defense questions the credibility of the witness's examination and report regarding Mr. Simpson's health, emphasizing that the witness did not document certain observations (like irregular gait) in the report and had no independent basis to evaluate Mr. Simpson's truthfulness during the examination.
   - The defense asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there was no evidence of an acute arthritic problem on June 15, 1994, which could have prevented him from committing the alleged crime.

2. **Prosecution's Important Claims:**
   - The witness (D_WITNESS) acknowledges that while he did not document everything in his report, his observations were based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own evaluations. He maintains that Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues but did not exhibit acute symptoms at the time of the examination.
   - The witness also suggests that certain injuries could be misidentified, indicating that knife cuts could mimic glass cuts, which could be relevant to the case.

3. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and accuracy of the witness's examination and report. The defense argues that critical observations were omitted, while the witness defends his methodology and the limitations of his report.
   - The defense challenges the witness's conclusions about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities, particularly regarding whether he could have committed the alleged murders, while the witness maintains that there were no physical limitations that would prevent such actions.
   - The defense also questions the witness's understanding of Mr. Simpson's symptoms and the potential for him to have motives to misrepresent his condition, which the witness acknowledges but insists did not affect his professional assessment.

Recent Exchanges:
PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?

Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts and disagreements.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor���s examination of Mr. Simpson was inadequate and that the doctor relied too heavily on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms without independent verification. They emphasize that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit any acute arthritic problems that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime.

   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately assess Mr. Simpson's condition during the examination on June 15th, highlighting the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and questioning the doctor's reliance on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. They assert that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit any acute arthritic problems that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that while Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement, he did not find evidence of an acute arthritic flare-up on June 15th.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenges the credibility of the doctor's report, pointing out that certain observations (like Mr. Simpson's gait) were not documented in the report and questioning the thoroughness of the examination.
   - There is a disagreement over whether the doctor considered the possibility that Mr. Simpson might have had a motive to misrepresent his symptoms. The defense suggests that the doctor lacked an independent basis to evaluate Mr. Simpson's truthfulness.
   - The defense also questions the doctor's decision not to refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, arguing that the chronic nature of his problems did not preclude the need for further evaluation.
   - The witness acknowledges that certain physical limitations were not found that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime, which the defense uses to bolster their argument. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a significant conflict between the defense's assertion of inadequate medical evaluation and the witness's defense of his professional assessment.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor.

Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately assess Mr. Simpson's condition during the examination on June 15th, 1994, and that there is no evidence to suggest Mr. Simpson had any acute arthritic problems that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime. They emphasize the lack of documentation regarding specific tests and findings in the doctor's report.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that while Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement, he did not find evidence of an acute arthritic flare-up during the examination.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the credibility of the doctor's report, highlighting the absence of notes and specific findings related to Mr. Simpson's gait and grip strength. They suggest that the doctor failed to conduct necessary tests that could have provided more insight into Mr. Simpson's condition.
   - The witness acknowledges the limitations of his examination but insists that he considered the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful about his symptoms. The defense counters this by pointing out that the doctor had no independent means to verify Mr. Simpson's honesty.
   - There is a disagreement over the interpretation of Mr. Simpson's physical limitations and whether they would have impacted his ability to commit the alleged crime. The defense argues that the doctor found no limitations that would prevent such an act, while the doctor clarifies that he did not specifically evaluate for that purpose.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's understanding of symptoms related to sweating and fever, suggesting that the doctor did not have complete information about Mr. Simpson's health leading up to the examination. The witness responds by stating that various factors could contribute to sweating, including physical activity. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a significant conflict between the defense's assertion of inadequate medical evaluation and the witness's defense of his professional assessment and findings.

He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the key claims and conflicts from both sides are as follows:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense argues that the witness, a doctor, did not adequately document or conduct necessary tests during the examination of Mr. Simpson on June 15th, 1994. They emphasize that the doctor���s report lacks critical observations regarding Mr. Simpson's physical condition and that he had no independent basis to assess Mr. Simpson's truthfulness about his symptoms.
   - **Witness (Doctor):** The doctor claims that his report is based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He maintains that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there was no evidence of an acute arthritic problem at the time of the examination.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and the absence of specific findings in his report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and the need for further orthopedic evaluation. They highlight that the doctor did not find any acute issues that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime.
   - The doctor disagrees with the defense's interpretation of his findings, asserting that while he did not document every detail, he conducted a comprehensive evaluation based on the information available to him. The defense also challenges the doctor's reliance on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms, suggesting that he may have had a motive to mislead the doctor, which the doctor acknowledges as a possibility but maintains that he based his conclusions on the information he had. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a significant conflict over the adequacy of the medical examination and the interpretation of Mr. Simpson's physical condition in relation to the case at hand.

He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts and disagreements.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately evaluate Mr. Simpson's condition and that there is a lack of objective evidence to support the doctor's conclusions about Mr. Simpson's health. They emphasize that the doctor relied heavily on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms without independent verification.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there were no acute arthritic problems at the time of the examination.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the doctor's lack of notes and the absence of specific findings in his report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and grip strength. They argue that the doctor failed to conduct necessary tests that could have provided more objective data.
   - The witness acknowledges that he did not perform certain tests but defends his evaluation as appropriate given the context of Mr. Simpson's chronic conditions. The defense challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson's symptoms were not acute and suggests that the doctor did not consider the possibility of Mr. Simpson being dishonest about his symptoms.
   - There is a disagreement over the doctor's role, with the defense suggesting that he should have been more of an advocate for Mr. Simpson, while the doctor insists that he was simply fulfilling his role as a physician without bias towards the defense. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a significant tension between the defense's skepticism of the doctor's methods and conclusions and the doctor's defense of his professional judgment and practices.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not conduct a thorough examination of Mr. Simpson and that his findings were based solely on the patient's self-reported history, which could be unreliable. They emphasize that the doctor failed to document significant observations and did not perform certain tests that could have provided more objective data regarding Mr. Simpson's condition.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that he conducted a proper examination and based his report on his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there was no evidence of an acute arthritic problem at the time of the examination.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the credibility of the doctor's report, highlighting the absence of specific findings related to Mr. Simpson's gait and the lack of documentation for certain tests, such as the grip strength test. They argue that the doctor had no independent basis to assess Mr. Simpson's truthfulness regarding his symptoms.
   - The witness disagrees with the defense's interpretation, stating that while he did not document every detail, he conducted a comprehensive evaluation. He also contends that the orthopedic issues were chronic and not acute, which justified his decision not to refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist immediately after the examination.
   - Additionally, the defense challenges the doctor's role, suggesting that he should have been more proactive in preparing a defense for Mr. Simpson, to which the doctor firmly responds that his responsibility was solely to provide medical care, not to advocate for acquittal.

   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not conduct a thorough examination of Mr. Simpson and that his findings were based solely on the patient's self-reported history, which could be unreliable. They emphasize that the doctor failed to document significant observations and did not perform certain tests that could have provided more objective data regarding Mr. Simpson's condition.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that he conducted a proper examination and based his report on both the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit any acute arthritic problems at the time of the examination and that his role was to provide medical care, not to advocate for Mr. Simpson in the legal context.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and the validity of his findings. The defense questions the absence of specific tests and notes in the doctor's report, suggesting that this undermines the credibility of his conclusions.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that he had no physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime. The witness counters that his findings were based on a lack of acute symptoms and chronic issues that did not require immediate intervention.
   - Additionally, the defense highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations, arguing that the doctor's assessments were not sufficiently objective, while the doctor insists that he acted within the norms of medical practice and did not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson in the legal sense.

Recent Exchanges:
PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts and disagreements:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense aimed to establish that the doctor's examination of Mr. Simpson was inadequate and that the doctor had no independent basis to evaluate Mr. Simpson's truthfulness regarding his symptoms. They emphasized that the doctor did not find any acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement at the time of the examination.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The doctor maintained that his report was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his observations during the examination. He acknowledged that while he did not find evidence of an acute arthritic problem, he did not rule out the possibility of chronic issues.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questioned the doctor's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, pointing out that he had no notes from the initial examination and that certain tests (like the grip strength test) were not performed. The defense argued that the doctor's subjective evaluations were insufficient to support his conclusions.
   - The witness disagreed with the defense's interpretation of his findings, asserting that he had not found any physical limitations that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime. The doctor also clarified that he did not consider himself an advocate for Mr. Simpson, which the defense seemed to imply was a conflict of interest.
   - There was a specific disagreement regarding the doctor's interpretation of Mr. Simpson's night sweats and their potential relevance to the case, with the defense suggesting that the doctor was trying to align his findings with the defense's narrative. The doctor, however, insisted that his observations were truthful and based on medical evaluations rather than an attempt to support Mr. Simpson's defense.

D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical evaluation and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately assess Mr. Simpson's physical condition and that there were no findings that would prevent him from committing the crime. They emphasize that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that there was no evidence of an acute arthritic problem at the time of the examination.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his observations. He acknowledges that while he did not find acute issues, he did not rule out the possibility of Mr. Simpson having some physical limitations.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenges the doctor's lack of notes and the absence of specific findings in his report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and grip strength. They argue that the doctor���s subjective evaluations were insufficient and that he failed to conduct necessary tests.
   - The witness contends that he did not find any acute issues during the examination and that his report reflects the findings accurately. He also states that he did not consider himself an advocate for Mr. Simpson, which the defense implies could affect the objectivity of his evaluation.
   - There is a disagreement over whether the doctor should have conducted further tests or referred Mr. Simpson to a specialist, with the defense suggesting that the doctor���s inaction undermines the credibility of his findings. The doctor, however, argues that the orthopedic issues were chronic and not acute, thus not requiring immediate referral. 

Overall, the conversation highlights a significant conflict between the defense's assertion of inadequate medical evaluation and the witness's defense of his professional assessment and methodology.

He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any acute arthritic problems that would prevent him from committing the crime, emphasizing that the doctor found no evidence of a need for a knee replacement and that Mr. Simpson's orthopedic issues were chronic rather than acute.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic issues, he did not find any physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. However, he also indicated that there were no acute symptoms observed during the examination.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenges the doctor's examination methods and the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) in the report, suggesting that the doctor's conclusions may be subjective and not fully supported by objective evidence.
   - The witness admits to the subjective nature of some evaluations but maintains that he based his report on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his observations. The defense questions the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms, suggesting he may have had a motive to mislead the doctor.
   - There is a disagreement over the doctor's role, with the defense implying that he acted as an advocate for Mr. Simpson, while the doctor insists he was merely fulfilling his role as a physician without any intent to prepare a defense for the charges against him. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the tension between the defense's attempt to undermine the credibility of the medical evaluation and the witness's insistence on the validity of his findings based on his professional judgment.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

Current Exchange:

D_WITNESS: That's correct.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the witness's examination of Mr. Simpson was flawed due to a lack of thorough documentation and that the witness did not adequately consider the possibility that Mr. Simpson might have had a motive to misrepresent his symptoms. They emphasize that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit any acute arthritic problems that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintains that his medical evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his findings were consistent with chronic orthopedic issues rather than acute ones.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenges the witness on the absence of specific findings in his report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and grip strength, suggesting that the witness's conclusions were subjective and not adequately supported by objective tests.
   - The witness acknowledges that some aspects of medical evaluation can be subjective but insists that he acted as a doctor rather than an advocate for Mr. Simpson, which the defense disputes by suggesting that the witness's statements could be interpreted as supportive of Mr. Simpson's defense.
   - There is a disagreement over whether Mr. Simpson's physical condition would have allowed him to commit the alleged acts of violence, with the defense asserting that he had the physical capability to do so, while the witness confirms that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife but does not explicitly address the broader implications of his physical strength in the context of the alleged crime.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?

   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) present conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any acute arthritic problems that would prevent him from committing the crime, emphasizing that the doctor found no evidence of a need for a knee replacement and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to pull back a victim's hair.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The witness maintains that his evaluation of Mr. Simpson was based on the history provided by the patient and his observations, asserting that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged acts.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and objectivity of the doctor's examination. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and notes that the doctor did not document certain observations in his report, suggesting a lack of comprehensive evaluation.
   - The defense also challenges the witness on whether he considered the possibility that Mr. Simpson might have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, while the witness insists that he based his findings on the information provided by Mr. Simpson.
   - Additionally, the defense highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations, arguing that the doctor's conclusions may not be entirely reliable, while the witness maintains that he acted as a physician rather than an advocate for Mr. Simpson. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a tension between the defense's attempt to undermine the credibility of the medical evaluation and the witness's insistence on the validity of his findings based on his professional judgment.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.

D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?

D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.

In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented important claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor���s evaluation of Mr. Simpson was flawed due to a lack of thorough examination and documentation. They emphasize that the doctor did not find any acute arthritic problems or physical limitations that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his report was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his observations during the examination. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that he could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenges the credibility of the doctor's findings, pointing out the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) in the report and questioning the doctor's reliance on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. The defense suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to mislead the doctor.
   - The witness disagrees with the defense's interpretation of his findings, insisting that while he did not find acute issues, he did not rule out the possibility of Mr. Simpson being capable of the actions described in the alleged crime. The doctor also clarifies that he does not consider himself an advocate for Mr. Simpson, which the defense implies could affect the objectivity of his evaluation. 

Overall, the conversation highlights a significant conflict between the defense's portrayal of the doctor's examination as inadequate and the doctor's defense of his professional assessment and conclusions.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that the doctor did not adequately assess Mr. Simpson's physical condition and that there is no evidence to suggest he was physically incapable of committing the alleged crime. They emphasize that the doctor���s report lacks critical details about Mr. Simpson's gait and grip strength, and they question the doctor's reliance on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserts that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic rather than acute, indicating that Mr. Simpson was physically capable of performing actions related to the alleged crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and the validity of his findings. The defense points out that the doctor did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - The defense also questions the doctor's interpretation of Mr. Simpson's symptoms, suggesting that the doctor may have been biased or failed to consider that Mr. Simpson might have had a motive to misrepresent his condition.
   - The doctor, on the other hand, insists that he acted as a medical professional without bias and that his conclusions were based on the information available to him at the time of the examination. He also clarifies that he did not see it as his responsibility to prepare a defense for Mr. Simpson against the charges. 

Overall, the conversation highlights a significant conflict between the defense's portrayal of the doctor's evaluation as inadequate and the doctor's defense of his professional judgment and findings.

Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute problems that would prevent him from committing the crime. However, he also indicates that his report was based on Mr. Simpson's history and observations, and he admits that medical evaluations can be subjective.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and accuracy of the doctor's examination and report. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and notes that the doctor did not document certain observations in his report, suggesting a lack of diligence.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that he did not consider Mr. Simpson's potential motive to lie about his symptoms, implying that this could affect the credibility of the doctor's findings.
   - The witness maintains that he did not see a need for further orthopedic evaluation after June 15th, which the defense disputes, arguing that the doctor should have sought additional opinions given the context of the case.
   - The defense attempts to portray the doctor as an advocate for Mr. Simpson, while the doctor insists that he was merely fulfilling his role as a physician without any intention to influence the legal proceedings.

D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts and disagreements.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense aimed to establish that the witness's examination of Mr. Simpson was flawed due to a lack of thorough documentation and objective testing. They emphasized that the doctor had no independent basis to evaluate Mr. Simpson's truthfulness regarding his symptoms and that he did not find any acute issues that would prevent Mr. Simpson from committing the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintained that he conducted a thorough examination based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He asserted that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic rather than acute.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense challenged the witness on the absence of specific findings in his report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and the grip strength test, arguing that the witness's subjective evaluations were insufficient.
   - There was a disagreement over whether Mr. Simpson had any physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. The witness stated that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the crime, while the defense sought to portray him as having significant limitations.
   - The defense also questioned the witness's role, asserting that he should have been more of an advocate for Mr. Simpson, while the witness insisted that his responsibility was solely to provide medical care and not to prepare a defense for the charges against him. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to undermine the credibility of the witness's findings and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical assessments.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the crime, emphasizing that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems during his examination and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to perform the actions described in the crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his observations, asserting that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not exhibit any acute conditions that would have hindered his physical capabilities at the time of the alleged crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and accuracy of the doctor's examination and report. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and notes that the doctor did not document certain observations in his report, suggesting a lack of diligence in assessing Mr. Simpson's condition.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that he did not consider Mr. Simpson's potential motive to lie about his symptoms, implying that this could affect the credibility of the doctor's findings.
   - Additionally, the defense argues that the doctor should have consulted with Mr. Simpson's orthopedist for a more specialized opinion on his orthopedic limitations, while the doctor insists that he did not see a need for such a consultation based on his assessment.
   - The witness's role as Mr. Simpson's doctor is also scrutinized, with the defense suggesting that the doctor should have been more proactive in preparing a defense for Mr. Simpson, which the doctor denies, stating that he was simply fulfilling his role as a physician.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute problems during the examination on June 15th. However, he also states that his report is based on Mr. Simpson's history and observations, and he did not conduct certain tests that could have provided more objective data.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and objectivity of the doctor's examination. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and notes that the doctor did not document certain observations in his report, suggesting a lack of diligence in evaluating Mr. Simpson's condition.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that he did not have an independent basis to evaluate Mr. Simpson's truthfulness, implying that the doctor's reliance on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms could be flawed.
   - Additionally, the defense highlights that the doctor did not refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist after the June 15th examination, suggesting that the doctor did not see any urgent need for further evaluation, which the defense argues supports their claim that Mr. Simpson was physically capable of the actions in question. The doctor, however, maintains that he was not responsible for preparing a defense for Mr. Simpson, indicating a professional boundary in his role.

Recent Exchanges:
PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the crime, emphasizing that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems during his examination and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to perform the actions described in the allegations.
   - **Witness Claim:** The witness maintains that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute conditions that would have impaired his ability to commit the crime. However, he also acknowledges that his evaluation was based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history and that he did not conduct certain tests that could have provided more objective data.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and objectivity of the doctor's examination. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and notes that the doctor did not document certain observations in his report, suggesting a lack of rigor in the evaluation.
   - The witness admits to the subjective nature of some of his assessments but insists that he acted as Mr. Simpson's doctor rather than an advocate for his defense. The defense counters this by pointing out that the witness's findings could be interpreted in a way that supports Mr. Simpson's innocence.
   - The defense also highlights that Mr. Simpson had not seen any other doctors for eleven months prior to the examination, which raises questions about the reliability of the witness's conclusions based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. The witness acknowledges this gap but maintains that he gathered all available medical records for context. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a complex interplay between medical evaluation and legal defense, with both sides presenting their interpretations of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities in relation to the charges against him.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented their important claims and highlighted their conflicts and disagreements as follows:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime. They emphasize that the doctor���s examination did not reveal acute issues that would impair Mr. Simpson's ability to perform actions such as holding a knife or pulling someone's hair.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation of Mr. Simpson was based on the history provided by the patient and his observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find evidence of acute problems during the examination on June 15th.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense questions the thoroughness and objectivity of the doctor's examination, pointing out that he did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more definitive evidence regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities. The doctor admits that some evaluations were subjective and that he did not have the necessary equipment for certain tests.
   - There is a disagreement over whether Mr. Simpson had a motive to misrepresent his symptoms during the examination. The defense suggests that the doctor had no independent basis to assess Mr. Simpson's truthfulness, while the doctor acknowledges the possibility of deceit but insists his report was based on the information provided by Mr. Simpson.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's decision not to refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist after the examination, arguing that it would have been more appropriate for a specialist to evaluate any orthopedic limitations. The doctor defends his decision by stating that there were no acute reasons for such a referral.
   - Finally, the defense highlights inconsistencies in the doctor's findings, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's physical condition on June 12th compared to June 15th, suggesting that if witnesses observed no limitations on June 12th, it contradicts the doctor's observations made three days later. The doctor acknowledges this potential inconsistency but maintains that he observed a limp during his examination.

D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?

   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the crime, emphasizing that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert strength necessary to commit the alleged acts.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute limitations during the examination on June 15th. However, he acknowledged that Mr. Simpson could have the strength to perform the actions described in the hypothetical scenarios presented by the defense.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the doctor's evaluation methods and the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. The defense questions the absence of detailed notes and the subjective nature of the doctor's assessments, suggesting that Mr. Simpson may have been dishonest about his condition.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's decision not to refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, arguing that it would have been more appropriate for a specialist to evaluate any orthopedic limitations.
   - The witness acknowledges the possibility that Mr. Simpson could have been faking a limp during the examination, which introduces doubt about the accuracy of the doctor's observations and conclusions.
   - Overall, the defense seeks to portray Mr. Simpson as physically capable, while the witness's testimony leaves room for interpretation regarding Mr. Simpson's actual physical state at the time of the alleged crime.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**

The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like a grip strength test) and the lack of independent verification of Mr. Simpson's claims, suggesting that the doctor may have been misled by Mr. Simpson's presentation.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson had a limp during the examination, proposing that he could have been faking it. The doctor acknowledges this possibility but maintains that he observed a limp.
   - Additionally, the defense highlights that the doctor did not refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist for further evaluation, suggesting that the doctor's assessment may not be comprehensive or authoritative in the context of orthopedic issues. The doctor defends his position by stating that there were no acute reasons for such a referral based on his findings. 

Overall, the conversation reveals a complex interplay of medical evaluation, subjective interpretation, and the implications of physical limitations in the context of the case against Mr. Simpson.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's physical condition and its implications for the case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged crime. They emphasize that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had some physical issues, he did not find any evidence of acute problems on June 15th. However, he also admits that his evaluation was based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history and observations, which could be subjective.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the reliability of the doctor's evaluation, particularly regarding whether Mr. Simpson had a motive to misrepresent his symptoms. The defense suggests that the doctor did not adequately consider the possibility of Mr. Simpson faking his condition.
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and whether he should have referred Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, given the chronic nature of his issues. The doctor maintains that there was no acute need for such a referral.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's subjective assessments, such as grip strength and the presence of a limp, suggesting that these could be exaggerated or fabricated by Mr. Simpson. The doctor concedes that subjective interpretation plays a role in medical evaluations.
   - Finally, the defense points out that the doctor did not have recent medical records to support his findings, as Mr. Simpson had not seen a doctor for eleven months prior to the examination, raising questions about the accuracy of the doctor's conclusions.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?

Did you ever ask him to run at any time?,I never asked him to run.,,Prosecution,D_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a legal examination of a medical witness regarding the health and physical capabilities of Mr. Simpson, who is implicated in a murder case. The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's physical condition and its implications for the case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. They emphasize that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had some physical issues, he did not find any evidence that would prevent him from committing the acts in question. However, he also admits that his evaluations were based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history and his own observations, which could be subjective.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the reliability of the doctor's evaluations, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's honesty during the examination. The defense suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to misrepresent his symptoms, while the doctor maintains that he based his findings on the information provided by Mr. Simpson.
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and whether he should have referred Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, given the chronic nature of his issues. The doctor defends his decision, stating that there were no acute reasons for such a referral.
   - The defense also raises the possibility that Mr. Simpson could have been faking his symptoms during the examination, which the doctor concedes is a possibility but does not assert as fact.
   - Additionally, the defense challenges the doctor's subjective assessments, particularly regarding grip strength and physical limitations, suggesting that these evaluations could be biased or incomplete. The doctor acknowledges the subjective nature of some of his assessments but insists on the validity of his findings based on his medical expertise.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--

D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's physical condition and its implications for the case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson's physical limitations, particularly concerning his knee and overall mobility, would not have prevented him from committing the alleged murders. They emphasize that the doctor did not find significant acute issues during his examination and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to perform the actions described in the charges.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation of Mr. Simpson was based on the history provided by the patient and his observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find acute problems that would have prevented him from physical actions, but he also admits that his assessment was subjective and that he did not conduct certain tests that could have provided more objective data.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and objectivity of the doctor's examination. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and the lack of detailed notes, suggesting that the doctor's conclusions may not be reliable.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson could have faked a limp during the examination, implying that the doctor's observations may not accurately reflect Mr. Simpson's condition on the day of the alleged murders.
   - The witness's claim that he did not consider himself an advocate for Mr. Simpson contrasts with the defense's implication that the doctor should have been more proactive in assessing Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities in relation to the charges against him. The defense suggests that the doctor���s role should have included preparing a defense based on his findings, which the doctor denies. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the tension between the defense's portrayal of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the doctor's more cautious, subjective assessment of his condition.

D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not exhibit any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. They emphasize that the doctor���s evaluations and reports do not support the notion that Mr. Simpson was incapacitated or unable to perform actions such as wielding a knife or pulling someone���s hair.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluations were based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history and his own observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find acute problems during the examination on June 15th, 1994, but he also admits that his assessments are somewhat subjective.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms and whether he had a motive to misrepresent his condition. The defense suggests that the doctor had no independent basis to assess Mr. Simpson's truthfulness, while the doctor insists that he considered the possibility of Mr. Simpson not being candid.
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and whether he should have referred Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, arguing that the doctor���s lack of objective testing (like a grip strength test) undermines his conclusions. The doctor counters that he did not find acute issues that warranted such a referral.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson could perform physical actions necessary for the alleged crimes, suggesting that the doctor���s evaluations were not comprehensive enough to support his conclusions. The doctor, however, maintains that Mr. Simpson could perform those actions under certain conditions.
   - Lastly, the defense implies that the doctor���s role as Mr. Simpson's physician does not equate to being an advocate for him in the context of the trial, which the doctor agrees with, stating he was there to provide medical care, not to prepare a defense.

D_WITNESS: Seven.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?

D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson, particularly concerning his physical capabilities and health status at the time of the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. They emphasize that the doctor did not find evidence of acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on Mr. Simpson's history and observations, and while he did not find acute issues, he acknowledged the possibility of Mr. Simpson faking symptoms. The doctor also noted that Mr. Simpson had not seen another physician for eleven months prior to the evaluation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and objectivity of the doctor's examination. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and the lack of detailed notes, suggesting that the doctor's conclusions may be subjective.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson could have performed the actions required to commit the crime, suggesting that the doctor's evaluation may not fully account for Mr. Simpson's physical condition or potential for deception.
   - The witness's claim that he did not consider Mr. Simpson's potential motive to lie during the examination is also contested, as the defense implies that this oversight could affect the validity of the doctor's findings. 

Overall, the conversation highlights a significant conflict between the defense's portrayal of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the doctor's medical assessment, raising questions about the reliability of the evaluation and the implications for the case.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, during the recess, did you count the number of abrasions that you
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: How many separate abrasions did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Seven.

Current Exchange:
PROSECUTION: And did you also count the number of cuts to his left hand?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson's medical condition, particularly regarding his knee and overall physical limitations, would not have prevented him from committing the murders. They emphasize that the doctor did not find any acute issues during his examination and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to commit the acts in question.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute arthritic problems during the examination. However, he acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could perform certain actions, like holding a knife, under specific conditions.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the doctor's evaluation methods and the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. The defense questions the absence of objective tests (like a grip strength test) and suggests that the doctor relied too heavily on Mr. Simpson's account without independent verification.

D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, during the recess, did you count the number of abrasions that you
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: How many separate abrasions did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Seven.

PROSECUTION: And did you also count the number of cuts to his left hand?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding the medical evaluation of Mr. Simpson, particularly concerning his physical condition and its implications for the case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson did not have any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. They emphasize that the doctor did not find evidence of acute arthritic problems during his examination and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation was based on Mr. Simpson's history and observations, and he acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson could perform certain actions, he also noted the presence of a limp and other physical issues that could be relevant to the case.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the thoroughness and accuracy of the doctor's examination. The defense questions the absence of specific tests (like the grip strength test) and the lack of detailed notes, suggesting that the doctor's conclusions may be subjective and not fully reliable.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson could have faked a limp, implying that the doctor's observations may not be conclusive evidence of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities at the time of the alleged crime.
   - Additionally, the defense points out that Mr. Simpson had not seen a doctor for eleven months prior to the examination, raising questions about the relevance of the doctor's findings to the events of June 12th, 1994. The witness, however, insists that he based his evaluation on the information available to him at the time. 

Overall, the conversation highlights a significant conflict between the defense's portrayal of Mr. Simpson's physical abilities and the doctor's medical findings, which could impact the case's outcome.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

PROSECUTION: How many separate abrasions did you identify?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for the case.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson's medical evaluations do not support the assertion that he had any significant physical limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged murders. They emphasize that the doctor did not find acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime.
   - **Witness Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluations were based on Mr. Simpson's self-reported history and his own observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find evidence of acute problems during the examination on June 15th, 1994.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement over the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms and whether he had a motive to misrepresent his condition. The defense suggests that the doctor had no independent basis to assess Mr. Simpson's truthfulness, while the doctor insists that he considered the possibility of Mr. Simpson not being candid.
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and whether he should have referred Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, arguing that the doctor���s subjective evaluations could be biased. The doctor counters that he did not find acute issues that warranted such a referral.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's conclusions about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities, suggesting that the doctor���s assessments were not comprehensive enough to rule out the possibility of Mr. Simpson being able to commit the alleged acts, especially under the influence of adrenaline.
   - Finally, there is a dispute regarding the source of Mr. Simpson's injuries, with the defense asserting that the doctor misrepresented where Mr. Simpson claimed to have sustained them. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the tension between the defense's portrayal of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the doctor's medical assessments, leading to significant conflicts in their testimonies.

D_WITNESS: That's correct.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?

D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--

   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson's medical condition, particularly regarding his knee and arthritis, would not have prevented him from committing the murders. They emphasize that the doctor found no acute issues during his examination and that Mr. Simpson could perform actions necessary for the alleged crime, such as holding a knife and pulling someone's hair.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation of Mr. Simpson was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute limitations that would prevent him from committing the crime, but he also admits that his assessment is subjective and relies on Mr. Simpson's honesty.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a significant disagreement over the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms and the doctor's interpretation of his physical capabilities. The defense suggests that Mr. Simpson may have been exaggerating or faking his symptoms, while the doctor insists that he took Mr. Simpson at his word during the examination.
   - The defense questions the thoroughness of the doctor's examination and whether he should have referred Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, arguing that the doctor���s findings were not comprehensive enough to rule out any limitations. The doctor counters that he did not find any acute issues that warranted such a referral.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's assertion that Mr. Simpson could have committed the crime, suggesting that the doctor's subjective evaluations may not accurately reflect Mr. Simpson's true physical state at the time of the alleged incident. The doctor, however, maintains that he observed a limp during his examination, which raises questions about Mr. Simpson's condition leading up to the crime. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the tension between the defense's portrayal of Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the doctor's medical assessments, with both sides presenting conflicting interpretations of the evidence.

D_WITNESS: That's correct.",simpson_defense_5,Dr. Robert Huizenga,Dr. Robert Huizenga was a defense witness in O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He examined Simpson and testified about his findings. Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, during the recess, did you count the number of abrasions that you
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: How many separate abrasions did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Seven.

PROSECUTION: And did you also count the number of cuts to his left hand?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: How many did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Three cuts, one of which, on the fourth finger, had both an a and B portion.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you said that Mr. Simpson told you he got these injuries in Chicago; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: No. That's incorrect.

PROSECUTION: That he cut it on glass?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, I want you to assume that there's been testimony received in this case that blood that was genetically tested and found to match Mr. Simpson's was found in the foyer and driveway areas of Mr. Simpson's home-- Doctor, in your opinion, would the kind of cuts that you observed in Mr.

Huizenga's testimony provided information about Simpson's physical ability to commit the crime.,"PROSECUTION: And the examination you did on the 15th of June, you say you have no notes of that; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I have no notes of that, no.

PROSECUTION: But you did in fact prepare a typewritten report; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where in your report did you list anything related to Mr. Simpson walking--I hate to use your terminology--like Tarzan's grandfather or having any kind of irregular gait, g-a-I-t?
D_WITNESS: Uh, that is not in the report. That was subsequently added--

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, would you agree that under normal circumstances, a doctor accepts as true the history that is given to him by the patient because of the belief that the patient has an incentive to be honest and candid with the physician in order that the physician can accurately identify any problem and subsequently treat it?
D_WITNESS: In most cases, that's true.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider the possibility in evaluating Mr. Simpson on June 15th that he had a motive to lie regarding his symptoms?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you have no independent basis on which to evaluate whether or not Mr. Simpson was truthful with you, fully candid or whether in fact he was pulling his punches with you, can you?
D_WITNESS: My report is based on the history that I obtained from him and my observations are the observations that I made of him.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, on the 17th, if you felt that you had been unable to adequately examine Mr. Simpson on the 15th, you had an opportunity to conduct any additional examinations you required; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: You didn't find any enlarged lymph node under the left armpit, did you, at that time?
D_WITNESS: I did not.

PROSECUTION: In your training, have you been taught for identifying osteoarthritis, that when you feel around the joint, you expect to find a hardening type of feeling, a bony type of feeling?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And have you also been taught--rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease; is it not?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if you're concerned about rheumatoid arthritis, there's something called a grip test that can be done, isn't there?
D_WITNESS: Yes, there is.

PROSECUTION: And that's a very simple test to do; is there not--is it not?
D_WITNESS: It requires some specialized things because typically you do it with a bulb with a gauge, and we don't have that at our office.

PROSECUTION: Well, doctor, can't it be done in fact using a blood pressure device? You do have a blood pressure device, you know, those cuff things that you pump up and then you have a column, a sphygmomanometer I think is the fancy name for it, right?
D_WITNESS: We do have that. I could have done that test, but that's not a typical thing to do and would be totally inappropriate for this exam.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, where is it recorded the grip strength test result in your report of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: Well, there are numerous things that are normal that aren't reported. As I said, two hours of our interreaction are certainly not recorded here.

PROSECUTION: On June 15th, did Mr. Simpson in your opinion need a knee replacement?
D_WITNESS: He did not need a knee replacement on the 15th.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, you made no effort to have him seen by an orthopedist after June 15th, between the June 15th and June 17th examinations; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: The orthopedic problems were chronic and something that would bother him over a many year period and were not of an acute nature, certainly not as acute as his other pressing problems.

PROSECUTION: And in fact, your opinion was that he had no evidence of an acute arthritic problem, that is a flare-up of any arthritic condition, whether it be osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis on June 15th, 1994; is that correct, doctor?
D_WITNESS: That is not correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, was there any finding made by you in--covered in whatever item no. 1 is which dealt with any physical limitation of Mr. Simpson's which in your opinion would have prevented him from murdering two human beings using a single-edged knife on June 12th of 1994?
D_WITNESS: No, there was not.

PROSECUTION: And, doctor, you said in response to Mr. Shapiro's question that a knife could give the appearance of a cut that you believe was due to glass; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I think there are certain glass cuts that can mimic knife cuts.

PROSECUTION: And there are knife cuts that can mimic glass cuts, right?
D_WITNESS: I think with a knife, if you're--if you're a surgeon, you can mimic a lot of things.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, in page 2 of your report you say on this night sweats issue: ""The patient admits to a month-long history of nocturnal sweats severe enough to awaken him and require him to towel off his entire body, then go to sleep or other non-soaked side of the bed without associated flushing or known fever,"" right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Now, if a person had an influenza and develops a fever, you would expect to see chills initially as the fever escalates, right?
D_WITNESS: During the evolving phase of the fever as it is going up, you are right, you would typically see chills.

PROSECUTION: Did you ever, prior to June 15th, 1994, receive any information as to what temperatures Mr. Simpson had over the period of, let's say, June 10th, through June 15th?
D_WITNESS: No. There are many causes of sweating, one of which is athletic endeavors or the use of your muscles in a--over a certain threshold.

PROSECUTION: And would it be correct, doctor, that the more vigorous the physical activity, the more sweating one might expect?
D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, during the recess, did you count the number of abrasions that you
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: How many separate abrasions did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Seven.

PROSECUTION: And did you also count the number of cuts to his left hand?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: How many did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Three cuts, one of which, on the fourth finger, had both an a and B portion.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you said that Mr. Simpson told you he got these injuries in Chicago; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: No. That's incorrect.

PROSECUTION: That he cut it on glass?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, I want you to assume that there's been testimony received in this case that blood that was genetically tested and found to match Mr. Simpson's was found in the foyer and driveway areas of Mr. Simpson's home-- Doctor, in your opinion, would the kind of cuts that you observed in Mr.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, you are suggesting that Mr. Simpson is not being truthful with these people regarding his medical condition because he views himself as a pitchman for a product as a result of which he is willing to say things that are not true to please the people paying him to make the speech? Is that what you are suggesting.
D_WITNESS: I cannot get inside Mr. Simpson's head.

PROSECUTION: Have you in any way tried to mislead this jury based on your medical findings and observations of Mr. Simpson on June the 15th?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: And to your knowledge was Mr. Simpson treated for the last three and a half years for arthritis?

PROSECUTION: And do you believe that that was to set up some type of Defense for a crime that would be committed five years or four years later?

The discussion can be categorized into several key issues, highlighting conflicts and disagreements between the Prosecution and the witness.

### 1. **Medical Examination and Reporting**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The witness did not take notes during the examination on June 15 but prepared a typewritten report. The Prosecution questions the thoroughness and accuracy of the report, particularly regarding Mr. Simpson's gait and any irregularities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges the lack of notes but insists that the report reflects his observations and the history provided by Mr. Simpson.

### 2. **Patient History and Truthfulness**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution suggests that Mr. Simpson may have had a motive to lie about his symptoms, questioning the reliability of the witness's assessment based solely on Mr. Simpson's account.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness admits to considering the possibility of Mr. Simpson being untruthful but maintains that his evaluation was based on the information provided and his observations.

### 3. **Physical Limitations and Capabilities**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution emphasizes that the witness found no acute arthritic problems and questions why Mr. Simpson was not referred to an orthopedist. They argue that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not prevent him from committing the alleged crimes.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness states that Mr. Simpson did not need a knee replacement and that his orthopedic issues were chronic, not acute. He also acknowledges that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and perform actions necessary for the alleged crime under certain conditions.

### 4. **Medical Tests and Evaluations**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution points out that the witness did not conduct certain tests (like a grip strength test) that could have provided more objective data about Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness explains that while he could have performed a grip test, it was not typical for the examination and that he relied on Mr. Simpson's self-reported limitations.

### 5. **Injuries and Their Causes**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution questions the witness about the nature of Mr. Simpson's injuries, suggesting they could be consistent with breaking glass rather than being inflicted during a violent act.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness acknowledges that certain cuts could mimic other types of injuries but does not definitively attribute the injuries to any specific cause.

### 6. **Subjectivity in Medical Interpretation**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution highlights the subjective nature of medical evaluations and questions the witness's objectivity, suggesting that he may have been influenced by his role as Mr. Simpson's doctor.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness agrees that there is subjectivity in medical interpretation but insists that his findings were based on factual observations and not influenced by any advocacy for Mr. Simpson.

### 7. **Overall Responsibility and Advocacy**
   - **Prosecution Argument**: The Prosecution challenges the witness on whether he felt it was part of his responsibility to prepare a Prosecution for Mr. Simpson, implying a potential bias in his testimony.
   - **Witness Response**: The witness firmly states that he does not see himself as an advocate for Mr. Simpson but rather as a medical professional providing an evaluation.

### Conclusion
The dialogue reveals significant conflicts between the Prosecution's portrayal of the witness's credibility and the thoroughness of his examination, and the witness's insistence on the validity of his medical findings. The Prosecution seeks to undermine the witness's conclusions regarding Mr. Simpson's physical capabilities and the implications of his injuries, while the witness maintains that his assessments were based on professional standards and the information available to him.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and the witness (a doctor) presented conflicting claims regarding Mr. Simpson's medical condition and its implications for his ability to commit the alleged crime.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense's Claim:** The defense argues that Mr. Simpson's medical condition, particularly his knee issues and arthritis, did not prevent him from committing the murders. They emphasize that the doctor found no acute arthritic problems and that Mr. Simpson could hold a knife and exert enough strength to commit the acts in question.
   - **Witness's Claim:** The doctor maintains that his evaluation of Mr. Simpson was based on the history provided by Mr. Simpson and his own observations. He acknowledges that while Mr. Simpson had chronic orthopedic issues, he did not find any acute limitations that would prevent him from committing the alleged acts.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a significant disagreement over the doctor's evaluation methods and the reliability of Mr. Simpson's self-reported symptoms. The defense questions the absence of detailed notes and the subjective nature of the doctor's assessments, suggesting that Mr. Simpson may have been exaggerating or faking his symptoms.
   - The defense also challenges the doctor's decision not to refer Mr. Simpson to an orthopedist, arguing that it would have been more appropriate for a specialist to evaluate Mr. Simpson's orthopedic limitations.
   - Additionally, the defense raises the possibility that Mr. Simpson could have faked a limp during the doctor's examination, which contradicts the doctor's observations of a limp on June 15th.
   - The witness's assertion that he cannot speculate on Mr. Simpson's motivations or truthfulness adds to the tension, as the defense seeks to portray the doctor as potentially biased or lacking thoroughness in his evaluation. 

Overall, the conversation highlights the defense's strategy to undermine the credibility of the medical evaluation while asserting that Mr. Simpson's physical condition would not have hindered his ability to commit the alleged crimes.

D_WITNESS: Given the humidity, given the patient's level of hydration, I think that that is generally a pretty reasonable assumption.

PROSECUTION: You were his doctor for the time on June 15th, 1994; isn't that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is absolutely correct.

PROSECUTION: In fact, doctor, from all the records you have obtained, when was the last time Mr. Simpson saw any other doctor?
D_WITNESS: He last saw you--he never had a, quote-unquote, doctor. He had an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Frank Jobe, who he saw July, I believe, 13, 1993, and at that time Dr. Jobe, an orthopedic specialist, felt that OJ was in an acute rheumatoid arthritis flare and then immediately sent to him Dr. Maltz.

PROSECUTION: And so your examination is taking place eleven months since his last examination by any physician, at least to your knowledge; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, do you consider yourself an advocate for Mr. Simpson?
D_WITNESS: I consider myself Mr. Simpson's doctor. When someone comes into my office, I'm their doctor.

PROSECUTION: And much of medical interpretation is subjective in nature, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: I think that there is a degree of subjectiveness and blood tests don't tell all that much in many instances.

PROSECUTION: Well, for example, the grip test, for example, you said you didn't use any kind of objective measuring device, you didn't have one, so you had the test as you demonstrated with me, and you felt that he had normal grip strength. That is a subjective evaluation, is it not, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, did you ever feel that it was part of your responsibility to try and prepare a Defense for Mr. Simpson to the charges?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, can you see that--do you have the copy of this letter in your material?
D_WITNESS: I don't have a copy of that.

PROSECUTION: So doctor, in your opinion, this doesn't reflect that you were an advocate for Mr. Simpson in asking one of his lawyers whether this represented the kind of statement he sought?
D_WITNESS: No, absolutely not. Basically in my mind it was he wanted me to summarize my entire findings and I didn't know if that was too much or too little detail. I knew that it was all truthful. I just didn't know if he wanted me to expand or contract because he had some problems with some of my charts apparently.

PROSECUTION: Did you consider that as part of that responsibility it was to try and get him acquitted of these charges?
D_WITNESS: No, I really didn't, as a matter of fact.

PROSECUTION: Would you look, if you would, please, the last paragraph of that letter directed to ""Dear Bob"" Mr. Shapiro.
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And for the record: ""The night sweats Mr. Simpson complained of may be pertinent to the Court testimony of the chauffeur who implied OJ was quite warm when he got in the limo. We need to follow up on this from a medical standpoint."" You wrote that, didn't you, doctor?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you told Mr. Shapiro on direct that in your opinion Mr. Simpson could hold a knife, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: Would he also be able, in your opinion, to grab the hair of Nicole Brown Simpson and yank her head back to hyperextend her neck prior to taking a knife and slashing at her throat area? Did he have the strength in his left hand to do that, sir.
D_WITNESS: In a stationary situation, yes.

PROSECUTION: And when stationary I want to you assume she has collapsed on the walkway in front of her condominium. That's the kind of condition you are talking about, right?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And in your opinion he could do that?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: And not only could he do that, doctor, in your opinion could he then with his right hand holding a knife slit her throat? Did he have the strength in his hand to do that?
D_WITNESS: Given a stationary hypothetical as you have said, yes, I believe that that would be possible.

PROSECUTION: If you wanted to portray Mr. Simpson in worse condition with respect to that knee and limitation of movement, you would have done so by giving him a greater limitation of flexion, 25 to 30, than what is described in your report as 15 to 10; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: I was basically talking off the top of my best of recollections and obviously wasn't reading my report when I gave that answer, but my report--

PROSECUTION: Doctor, has Mr. Simpson been evaluated at your suggestion by an orthopedist, since June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I discussed it with his orthopedist. His--he has no acute reasons to be seen by an orthopedist currently, so no, he has not.

PROSECUTION: Would you agree it would be more appropriate to have his orthopedist come in and give an opinion on an area within the orthopedist's field of specialty than for you who by your admission is not an orthopedist--
D_WITNESS: Correct.

PROSECUTION: Dr. Huizenga, wouldn't it be appropriate, if one were concerned about orthopedic limitations of Mr. Simpson to have Dr. Jobe, his orthopedist of many years, examine him before trial, right?
D_WITNESS: I'm not conducting the Defense.

PROSECUTION: My question, doctor, is what, if anything, have you done to independently evaluate any limitations Mr. Simpson may have had over the last three months of his life before June 15th, 1994?
D_WITNESS: I have requested all his previous medical records, but of course those are not helpful in the last three months.

PROSECUTION: Because he hadn't seen a doctor for eleven months?
D_WITNESS: That is exactly correct.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, assuming that these same witnesses, when asked about any observation of any kind of physical limitation or evidence of distress by Mr. Simpson indicated they saw no such limitation or distress, assuming that that is accurate testimony, would that be inconsistent with what you would expect on June 12th, given your findings of June 15th?
D_WITNESS: I saw a limp on the 15th. If he had no limp on the 12th, then obviously something has changed in the interval.

PROSECUTION: Or perhaps Mr. Simpson was faking a limp in your office?
D_WITNESS: That certainly would be in the differential.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, what did do you to assess the power of his upper torso?
D_WITNESS: Basically looking at the flexion contractures of the elbows and the difficulty with the wrist. That is--that is--that is the only point that I'm basing that on.

PROSECUTION: And doctor, for example, would you describe the condition of Mr. Simpson's upper torso.
D_WITNESS: Absolutely well-muscled.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after being enraged, you would expect that he would be in the throes of an adrenaline rush; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: That is correct.

PROSECUTION: What test did you do to see Mr. Simpson ever attempt to run to see how well he could run? Did you ever ask him to run at any time?
D_WITNESS: I never asked him to run.

PROSECUTION: And that would be the best test, would it not, to see how well he could run given his arthritic condition as you found it?
D_WITNESS: He told me he could not run and you're right, I took him at his word.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, doctor, if Mr. Simpson had had a glove on his left hand, that area would in your opinion be covered if the glove were still being worn; would it not be the situation?
D_WITNESS: It would be difficult to get this sort of abrasion unless there was something inside the glove if in fact your--your premise of wearing a glove were correct, yes.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, during the recess, did you count the number of abrasions that you
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: How many separate abrasions did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Seven.

PROSECUTION: And did you also count the number of cuts to his left hand?
D_WITNESS: Yes, I did.

PROSECUTION: How many did you identify?
D_WITNESS: Three cuts, one of which, on the fourth finger, had both an a and B portion.

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you said that Mr. Simpson told you he got these injuries in Chicago; is that correct?
D_WITNESS: No. That's incorrect.

PROSECUTION: That he cut it on glass?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: Doctor, I want you to assume that there's been testimony received in this case that blood that was genetically tested and found to match Mr. Simpson's was found in the foyer and driveway areas of Mr. Simpson's home-- Doctor, in your opinion, would the kind of cuts that you observed in Mr.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Doctor, you are suggesting that Mr. Simpson is not being truthful with these people regarding his medical condition because he views himself as a pitchman for a product as a result of which he is willing to say things that are not true to please the people paying him to make the speech? Is that what you are suggesting.
D_WITNESS: I cannot get inside Mr. Simpson's head.

PROSECUTION: Have you in any way tried to mislead this jury based on your medical findings and observations of Mr. Simpson on June the 15th?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: And to your knowledge was Mr. Simpson treated for the last three and a half years for arthritis?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: And do you believe that that was to set up some type of Defense for a crime that would be committed five years or four years later?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Is there any patient that you treat that would not be capable of cutting someone with a knife?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: --is your opinion any different as to whether or not Mr. Simpson had any
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Is the cut on the index finger of Mr. Simpson consistent with somebody who broke a drinking glass that you would find in a hotel bathroom?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Now, doctor, you did see what you said I think originally was the commercial video?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And all of the aerobic exercise that we see in that type of environment is included in the commercial video. Some of what we saw because, they didn't multiple takes, is not included in the commercial video, correct?
D_WITNESS: That's correct.

PROSECUTION: And the commercial video has Mr. Simpson taking golf swings and shooting a basketball and so forth; is that correct?
