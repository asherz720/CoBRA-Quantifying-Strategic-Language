Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.

     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**

     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**

   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**

   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.

In the court conversation, the defense is questioning Officer Ridge about the number of individuals present at the scene when the bodies were recovered, seeking to establish the credibility and thoroughness of the investigation. The defense's important claim seems to revolve around the potential lack of comprehensive documentation or oversight regarding the personnel involved in the recovery process.

On the other hand, the prosecution may be emphasizing the reliability of the investigation and the procedures followed, suggesting that the presence of multiple individuals does not undermine the integrity of the evidence collected. 

The conflict arises from the defense's attempt to highlight possible gaps in the investigation by questioning the officer's ability to recall specific names, which could imply a lack of thoroughness or accountability. The disagreement centers on the adequacy of the investigative process and the implications of the officer's inability to provide a complete list of personnel present at the scene.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**

In the court conversation, the defense is focused on establishing the presence and actions of various individuals at the scene where the bodies were recovered. The important claims from the defense include:

1. **Defense Claim**: The defense is trying to clarify who was present at the scene during the recovery of the bodies, specifically questioning the involvement of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team and city employees.

2. **Witness Claim**: The witness, Officer Ridge, confirms that he saw certain detectives at the scene but does not recall any members of the Search and Rescue team being present at the time the bodies were found. He acknowledges that city employees arrived later to assist with pumping water from the stream after the bodies had been removed.

The conflicts and disagreements arise primarily from the defense's insistence on the presence of the Search and Rescue team and the timeline of when various individuals arrived at the scene. The witness's inability to confirm the presence of the Search and Rescue team at the time of the recovery creates a point of contention, as the defense seeks to establish a narrative regarding the search efforts and the handling of the scene.

In the court conversation, the defense is questioning Officer Ridge about the circumstances surrounding the recovery of bodies at a specific location. 

1. **Important Claims from Each Side:**
   - **Defense:** The defense is trying to establish the presence (or absence) of various individuals and teams during the recovery of the bodies, particularly questioning whether members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team were present at the scene and the timeline of when city employees arrived to assist.
   - **Witness (Officer Ridge):** The witness confirms that he saw specific detectives at the scene but does not recall seeing members of the Search and Rescue team. He acknowledges that city employees came to help pump water after the bodies were recovered.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreement:**
   - The primary conflict arises from the defense's inquiry into the presence of the Search and Rescue team, with the witness stating he did not see them at the scene, which could imply a lack of thorough search efforts. The defense is attempting to clarify the timeline and the involvement of various parties, while the witness's responses suggest a limited presence of additional support during the critical moment of recovery. There is also a minor disagreement regarding the estimation of distance from the recovery site to the service road, with the witness providing an approximate distance but not an exact figure.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense is questioning Officer Ridge about the circumstances surrounding the recovery of bodies at a crime scene. 

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is trying to establish the presence (or absence) of various individuals and teams at the crime scene, particularly questioning whether members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team were present when the bodies were recovered.
   - **Witness Claim:** Officer Ridge confirms that he saw certain detectives at the scene but does not recall seeing any members of the search and rescue team during the recovery of the bodies. He acknowledges that city employees were present after the bodies were removed to assist with pumping water from the stream.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreement:**
   - The defense and the witness appear to disagree on the timeline and presence of personnel at the scene. The defense is attempting to clarify who was there during the critical moments of the recovery, while Officer Ridge's responses suggest a lack of clarity or memory regarding the exact details of who was present at the time the bodies were found.
   - Additionally, there is a focus on the visibility and audibility of the interstate traffic from the crime scene, with the defense trying to establish how the location might have affected witnesses' ability to see or hear anything relevant to the case. Officer Ridge indicates that visibility would be limited from the creek bottom, which could impact the defense's argument regarding potential witnesses or evidence.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense is questioning Officer Ridge about the circumstances surrounding the recovery of bodies at a crime scene. 

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is trying to establish the presence (or absence) of various individuals and teams at the crime scene, particularly questioning whether members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team were present when the bodies were recovered. They also aim to clarify the visibility and accessibility of the crime scene in relation to the nearby service road and interstate.
   - **Witness Claim:** Officer Ridge confirms the presence of certain detectives at the scene but denies seeing any members of the search and rescue team during the recovery. He acknowledges that city employees were present after the bodies were removed to assist with pumping water.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a conflict regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene, with the defense suggesting they were there while Officer Ridge states he did not see them.
   - The defense is also probing into the visibility of the crime scene from the interstate and the service road, with Officer Ridge indicating that visibility would be limited from the creek bottom but possible from higher ground. This suggests a disagreement on how accessible the scene was to passersby on the interstate. 
   - The defense's questioning implies a need to establish the context of the crime scene's location and the potential for witnesses to have seen or heard something relevant, which Officer Ridge's responses seem to complicate.

In the court conversation, the key claims and conflicts from both sides are as follows:

1. **Defense's Important Claim**: The defense is attempting to establish the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the bodies, including the presence of various personnel at the scene and the visibility and audibility of the area. They aim to suggest that the conditions at the crime scene may have affected the ability to hear or see anything from the interstate or the truck wash.

2. **Prosecution's Important Claim**: The prosecution is focused on the actions taken during the investigation, including whether experiments were conducted to assess visibility and audibility from the ditch where the bodies were found. They are likely trying to establish the thoroughness of the investigation and the reliability of witness accounts.

**Conflicts and Disagreements**:
- There is a disagreement regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene, with the witness stating they did not see any members there.
- The defense is trying to clarify the distances and visibility from the crime scene to the interstate and the truck wash, while the prosecution may be questioning the reliability of the witness's observations and the investigative methods used.
- The defense's line of questioning suggests a focus on the physical conditions that could impact the investigation, while the prosecution seems to be probing the adequacy of the investigative procedures and the witness's involvement in any experiments related to the case.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the key claims and conflicts from both sides are as follows:

1. **Defense's Important Claim**: The defense is attempting to establish the conditions at the crime scene, including the visibility and accessibility of the area where the bodies were recovered. They are questioning the witness, Officer Ridge, about the presence of other individuals during the recovery, the distance from the service road, and the environmental conditions that may have affected visibility and sound.

2. **Prosecution's Important Claim**: The prosecution seems to be focused on the actions taken during the investigation, including whether experiments were conducted to assess visibility and sound from the ditch where the bodies were found. They are likely trying to establish the credibility of the investigation and the findings related to the crime scene.

**Conflicts and Disagreements**:
- There is a disagreement regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene. The defense suggests they were there, while the witness states he did not see them.
- The defense is trying to clarify the visibility from the crime scene to the interstate and the Blue Beacon Truck Wash, while the prosecution may be looking to challenge the reliability of the witness's observations and the methods used during the investigation.
- The defense is also probing into the environmental conditions, such as the density of the forest and the ability to hear traffic, which may conflict with the prosecution's narrative about the crime scene's accessibility and visibility.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

22,22,60,Q/A,Also west and...,North.,,DEFENSE,P_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a complex exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley. Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a discussion that highlighted several conflicts and disagreements.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is attempting to establish the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the bodies, including the presence of individuals at the scene and the visibility of the area from the service road and the interstate. They aim to suggest that the conditions may have affected the ability to see or hear anything significant related to the case.
   - **Prosecution Claim:** The prosecution is focused on the actions taken during the investigation, including whether experiments were conducted to assess visibility and sound from the ditch where the bodies were found. They are likely trying to establish the reliability of witness accounts and the thoroughness of the investigation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a conflict regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene. The witness could not confirm their presence during the recovery of the bodies, which the defense is using to question the thoroughness of the search efforts.
   - The defense is also probing into the visibility and sound conditions at the crime scene, suggesting that the dense forest and distance from the interstate may have hindered witnesses' ability to see or hear anything relevant. This contrasts with the prosecution's likely aim to establish that the area was accessible and that witnesses could have observed or heard important details.
   - The defense's questioning about the distance from the service road to the recovery site and the ability to see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash indicates a disagreement over the geographical context of the crime scene, which may be crucial for understanding witness testimonies and the events that transpired.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.

     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the key claims and conflicts from both sides are as follows:

1. **Defense's Important Claims:**
   - The defense is attempting to establish the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the bodies, including the presence of personnel at the scene and the visibility from the crime scene to the surrounding areas, such as the service road and the Blue Beacon Truck Wash.
   - They emphasize the difficulty of seeing or hearing anything from the creek bottom where the bodies were found, suggesting that the environment may have impacted the ability to witness or hear events occurring nearby.

2. **Prosecution's Important Claims:**
   - The prosecution is focused on the actions taken during the investigation, including whether experiments were conducted to assess visibility and sound from the ditch where the bodies were found.
   - They aim to challenge the defense's narrative by highlighting any potential oversights or gaps in the witness's testimony regarding the investigation process.

3. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene, with the witness stating they did not see any members there, which the defense is trying to clarify.
   - The defense and prosecution appear to have differing views on the visibility and audibility of the area surrounding the crime scene, with the defense suggesting it was difficult to see or hear anything from the creek bottom, while the prosecution may be trying to establish that it was possible to do so.
   - The defense is also trying to clarify the geographical layout and distances involved, which may be contested by the prosecution in terms of their relevance to the case.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
1. **Important Claims from Each Side:**
   - **Defense:** The defense is attempting to establish the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the bodies, including the presence of personnel at the scene, the visibility of the area, and the distance from the service road. They aim to suggest that the conditions may have affected the ability to hear or see anything significant related to the case.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution is focused on the actions taken during the investigation, including whether experiments were conducted to assess visibility and sound from the crime scene. They are likely trying to establish the reliability of witness accounts and the thoroughness of the investigation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreement:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene of the body recovery, with the witness stating they did not see any members there.
   - The defense is probing into the visibility and audibility from the crime scene, suggesting that the dense forest and distance from the interstate may have hindered witnesses' ability to see or hear anything relevant, while the prosecution may be trying to counter this by emphasizing the thoroughness of the investigation and the conditions at the time. 
   - The defense is also questioning the witness's ability to estimate distances and visibility, which may imply a challenge to the credibility of the witness's observations.

In the court conversation, the key claims and conflicts from both sides are as follows:

1. **Defense's Important Claims:**
   - The defense is attempting to establish the presence and actions of various individuals at the crime scene, particularly questioning the witness about who was present when the bodies were recovered and the visibility of the area from the service road and the creek bottom.
   - They aim to demonstrate that the location of the bodies was somewhat isolated, making it difficult for someone to hear or see anything from the nearby interstate or truck wash.

2. **Prosecution's Important Claims:**
   - The prosecution is focused on the actions taken during the investigation, including whether experiments were conducted to assess visibility and sound from the ditch where the bodies were found.
   - They are likely trying to establish the credibility of the witness and the thoroughness of the investigation.

3. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene, with the witness stating they did not see any members there.
   - The defense is trying to clarify the geographical layout and visibility from the crime scene, while the prosecution may be looking to challenge the defense's narrative by emphasizing the investigative procedures and any experiments conducted to assess sound and visibility.
   - The defense's questioning suggests a focus on the limitations of visibility and sound at the crime scene, which may conflict with the prosecution's narrative about the events surrounding the discovery of the bodies.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a discussion that highlighted several conflicts and disagreements.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense aimed to establish the presence and visibility of the crime scene in relation to the surrounding area, including the proximity to the service road and the ability to hear or see traffic from the interstate. They sought to question the thoroughness of the investigation and the presence of search and rescue teams at the scene.
   - **Prosecution Claim:** The prosecution focused on the investigative procedures, including whether experiments were conducted to assess visibility and sound from the crime scene, implying that the investigation was comprehensive and that the witness's observations were relevant to the case.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene. The witness indicated they did not see any members present during the recovery of the bodies, which the defense used to question the thoroughness of the search efforts.
   - The defense and witness had a misunderstanding about the elevation of the banks of the stream, leading to confusion over which bank was higher. This highlighted a potential discrepancy in the witness's understanding of the geography of the crime scene, which the defense sought to clarify.
   - The defense's line of questioning suggested that the visibility and audibility from the crime scene were limited, which could impact the investigation's findings, while the prosecution aimed to affirm the validity of the investigative methods used. 

Overall, the conversation revealed a tension between the defense's attempts to undermine the credibility of the investigation and the prosecution's efforts to uphold it.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of questions regarding the circumstances surrounding the recovery of bodies at a crime scene.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense is attempting to establish the conditions at the crime scene, including the visibility and accessibility of the area where the bodies were found. They are questioning the witness, Officer Ridge, about the presence of other individuals during the recovery and the geographical layout of the site, suggesting that the scene may not have been as isolated as implied.
   - **Prosecution Claim:** The prosecution is focused on the actions taken during the investigation, including whether experiments were conducted to assess sound visibility from the ditch where the bodies were found. They aim to establish the credibility of the investigation and the witness's observations.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a conflict regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene. The defense suggests that they were not present during the recovery of the bodies, while the prosecution may imply that their absence is significant.
   - The defense and witness have a disagreement about the geographical features of the crime scene, particularly regarding the heights of the banks of the stream and visibility from different locations. The defense is trying to clarify the layout to support their argument, while the witness struggles to articulate the specifics, leading to confusion.
   - The defense is also probing into the ability to hear and see traffic from the crime scene, which could impact the narrative of the events surrounding the recovery of the bodies. The prosecution's line of questioning about the experiment indicates a focus on the sound dynamics in the area, which may contradict the defense's claims about visibility and noise.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?

P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of questions regarding the circumstances surrounding the recovery of bodies at a crime scene.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense aimed to establish the presence and actions of various individuals at the crime scene, including the absence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team and the visibility of the truck wash from the recovery site. They sought to highlight the conditions of the environment and the potential for sound to travel from the scene.
   - **Prosecution Claim:** The prosecution focused on the investigative procedures, including whether experiments were conducted to assess visibility and sound at the crime scene, implying that these factors could be relevant to the case.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene, with the witness stating they were not present during the recovery of the bodies.
   - The defense and witness had conflicting interpretations of the elevations and visibility from different points along the stream, particularly concerning the heights of the banks and the ability to see the truck wash and hear traffic from the recovery site.
   - The defense also sought to clarify the terminology used in the engineering diagrams, which led to confusion about the definitions of ""high bank"" and ""shelf,"" indicating a lack of consensus on the physical geography of the crime scene. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's efforts to question the thoroughness of the investigation and the conditions at the crime scene, while the prosecution aimed to affirm the investigative methods used.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground.

Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --",Yes sir.,,DEFENSE,P_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a complex exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley. Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the key claims and conflicts from both sides are as follows:

1. **Defense's Important Claims:**
   - The defense is attempting to establish the presence and visibility of the crime scene in relation to the surrounding area, particularly the service road and the Blue Beacon Truck Wash. They are questioning the witness about the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies and the conditions at the scene, including visibility and sound.
   - The defense also emphasizes that no evidence linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene, as indicated by the analysis of the tennis shoes sent to the Crime Lab.

2. **Prosecution's Important Claims:**
   - The prosecution is focused on the details of the investigation, including whether experiments were conducted to assess visibility and sound from the crime scene. They aim to establish the credibility of the investigation and the findings related to the crime.

3. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There is a disagreement regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene, with the witness stating they did not see any members there during the recovery of the bodies.
   - The defense and witness have conflicting interpretations of the elevations and visibility from different points around the crime scene, particularly concerning the heights of the banks and the ability to see the truck wash from the recovery site.
   - The defense's assertion that no evidence linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene contrasts with the prosecution's efforts to establish the thoroughness of the investigation and the relevance of the evidence collected.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?

In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of conflicts and disagreements regarding the details of the crime scene and the investigation.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish the presence and actions of various individuals at the crime scene, questioning the witness about who was present when the bodies were recovered and the visibility and accessibility of the area. They sought to highlight the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene, particularly regarding the tennis shoes that were analyzed.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on the investigative procedures, including whether experiments were conducted to assess the audibility of sounds from the crime scene, implying that the defense's claims about visibility and sound might undermine the reliability of witness accounts.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene, with the witness stating they did not see any members there during the recovery of the bodies.
   - The defense and witness had conflicting interpretations of the geography of the crime scene, particularly regarding the elevation of the banks of the stream and the visibility of the truck wash from the recovery site.
   - The defense sought to clarify the details of the crime scene layout and the conditions under which the bodies were found, while the prosecution appeared to challenge the relevance of these details to the case.
   - The defense also questioned the results of the forensic analysis of the tennis shoes, emphasizing that no evidence linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime, which the prosecution did not directly address in their questioning. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to create reasonable doubt by questioning the investigation's thoroughness and the evidence's reliability, while the prosecution aimed to reinforce the credibility of the investigative process.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?

P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?

35,35,78,Q/A,Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?,Yes sir.,,DEFENSE,P_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a complex exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley. Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of questions regarding the circumstances surrounding the recovery of bodies and the subsequent investigation.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense Claim:** The defense aimed to establish the presence and actions of various individuals at the crime scene, questioning the witness about who was present during the recovery of the bodies and the visibility and accessibility of the area. They sought to highlight potential gaps in the investigation and the lack of evidence linking the accused, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution Claim:** The prosecution focused on the investigative procedures, including the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley and the collection of evidence, such as the tennis shoes. They aimed to counter the defense's narrative by emphasizing the thoroughness of the investigation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement regarding the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the scene, with the witness stating they did not see any members there, which the defense sought to clarify.
   - The defense and witness had conflicting interpretations of the geography of the crime scene, particularly concerning the elevations of the banks of the stream and the visibility of the truck wash from the recovery site.
   - The defense questioned the results of the analysis of the tennis shoes, which did not link Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene, indicating a potential weakness in the prosecution's case. The prosecution, however, did not pursue this line of questioning further, suggesting a strategic disagreement on how to present evidence. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's thoroughness and the evidence's relevance, while the prosecution aimed to maintain the integrity of their investigative process.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground.

Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.

     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of conflicts and disagreements regarding the investigation of a crime scene where bodies were recovered.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish the presence and actions of various individuals at the crime scene, questioning the witness about who was present during the recovery of the bodies and the visibility and accessibility of the area. They sought to highlight the lack of evidence linking their client, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene, particularly regarding the tennis shoes that were analyzed but found to have no positive connection.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on the investigative procedures, including the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley and the experiments conducted to assess visibility and sound at the crime scene.

   - The defense and witness had conflicting interpretations regarding the elevations of the banks of the stream, with the defense trying to clarify the heights and the witness explaining the terminology used by engineers.
   - The defense questioned the results of the tennis shoe analysis, emphasizing that nothing linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime, while the prosecution did not provide further commentary on this point, indicating a potential disagreement on the significance of the evidence.
   - The defense also sought to reserve the right to recall the witness for further examination of photographs, suggesting ongoing disputes about the evidence presented. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's thoroughness and the evidence's relevance, while the prosecution aimed to affirm the legitimacy of their investigative methods.

   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on the investigative procedures and the actions taken by law enforcement, including experiments conducted at the crime scene to assess visibility and sound.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?

P_WITNESS: North.

P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene where bodies were recovered.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish the presence and actions of various individuals at the crime scene, questioning the witness about who was present during the recovery of the bodies and the visibility of the area from the service road and the truck wash. They sought to highlight the lack of evidence linking their client, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene, particularly regarding the tennis shoes that were analyzed but found to have no connection.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution's claim revolved around the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the questioning about his whereabouts and potential involvement in a cult indicated he was a suspect, despite the witness's assertion that he was not considered a suspect at that time.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, which the defense sought to clarify.
   - The defense and witness had conflicting interpretations regarding the elevations of the banks of the stream, with the defense trying to clarify the topography and the witness explaining the engineering terminology used to describe the banks.
   - A significant point of contention arose when the defense questioned the witness about Mr. Misskelley's status during the interrogation, with the defense asserting that asking about his whereabouts indicated he was a suspect, while the witness maintained that he was not considered a suspect at that time.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene where bodies were recovered.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish the presence and actions of various individuals at the crime scene, questioning the witness about the search efforts and the visibility of the area. They sought to demonstrate that the conditions at the scene may have affected the investigation and the ability to link the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, implying that the questioning was legitimate and that the witness's involvement in the investigation was appropriate, despite the defense's attempts to suggest otherwise.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implications.
   - The defense and witness had conflicting interpretations of the geography of the crime scene, particularly regarding the elevation of the banks of the stream and visibility from different locations.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, questioning the logic of asking him about his whereabouts if he was not considered a suspect, which the witness maintained was correct. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's integrity and the treatment of the suspect, while the prosecution defended the legitimacy of their actions.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of conflicts and disagreements regarding the investigation of a crime scene where bodies were recovered.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish the presence and actions of various individuals at the crime scene, questioning the witness about the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies and the visibility of the area from the service road. They sought to demonstrate that the investigation may have been flawed or incomplete, particularly regarding the lack of evidence linking their client, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution's claim focused on the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the questioning was legitimate and that he was not initially considered a suspect. They aimed to counter the defense's implications that the investigation was mishandled or that Mr. Misskelley was unfairly targeted.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, which the defense sought to clarify.
   - The defense and witness had conflicting interpretations regarding the geography of the crime scene, particularly concerning the elevation of the banks of the stream and visibility from different locations.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, questioning the logic of asking him about his whereabouts on a specific date without him being a suspect, which the witness maintained was standard procedure.
   - The defense also sought to reserve the right to recall the witness for further questioning about photographs of the crime scene, indicating ongoing disputes about the evidence presented. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's integrity and the treatment of Mr. Misskelley, while the prosecution defended the legitimacy of their actions and the investigative process.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of conflicts and disagreements regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish the presence and actions of various individuals at the crime scene, questioning the witness about the search efforts and the visibility of the area. They sought to demonstrate that the conditions at the scene may have affected the investigation and the reliability of witness accounts.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on the interrogation of the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, and the context in which he was questioned. They aimed to establish that the police had a legitimate reason to interrogate him based on information about a cult, suggesting that he was a person of interest in the investigation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, which the defense sought to clarify.
   - The defense and witness had conflicting interpretations of the geography of the crime scene, particularly regarding the elevations of the banks of the stream and visibility from different locations.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, questioning the logic of asking him about his whereabouts if he was not considered a suspect.
   - The defense also sought to clarify the basis for the cult-related questions posed to Mr. Misskelley, indicating a potential lack of evidence linking him to the crime, which the prosecution did not directly address in this segment. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's integrity and the treatment of the suspect.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of conflicts and disagreements regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene and the credibility of the evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They highlighted that no positive evidence was found from the tennis shoes sent to the Crime Lab.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the interrogation process, implying that the questioning of Mr. Misskelley was standard procedure and not indicative of him being a suspect at that time.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implication that they were involved.
   - The defense challenged the witness's understanding of the crime scene's geography, particularly regarding the elevations of the banks of the stream, leading to confusion about the layout and visibility from different points.
   - A significant point of contention arose during the interrogation discussion, where the defense argued that questioning Mr. Misskelley about his whereabouts indicated he was a suspect, while the witness maintained that he was not considered a suspect at that time, leading to a broader debate about the nature of police procedures and the basis for suspect identification.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.

Is that correct?",Yes sir.,,DEFENSE,P_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a complex exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley. Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish the presence and actions of various individuals at the crime scene, questioning the reliability of the investigation and the evidence linking their client, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They highlighted that no positive evidence was found linking him to the scene, particularly regarding the tennis shoes sent for analysis.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the presence of a cult-like group, implying that Mr. Misskelley was involved in suspicious activities. They aimed to support the notion that the interrogation was justified based on information received about cult activities.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implication that they were involved.
   - The defense questioned the witness about the interrogation process, asserting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect when he was merely being questioned about his whereabouts. The witness maintained that he was not a suspect at that time, leading to a conflict over the interpretation of the interrogation's nature.
   - The defense also challenged the prosecution's claims regarding the existence of cult activities, pointing out that no evidence was found to support the allegations, which the witness confirmed, indicating a lack of findings at the supposed cult meeting location. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's integrity and the evidence against their client.

P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of conflicts and disagreements regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish the presence and actions of various individuals at the crime scene, questioning the reliability of the investigation and the evidence linking their client, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They highlighted that no positive evidence was found linking him to the scene, particularly regarding the tennis shoes sent for analysis.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the presence of a cult-related motive, questioning the witness about the interrogation process and the information received regarding cult activities.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered.
   - The defense questioned the witness about the visibility and sound from the interstate at the crime scene, suggesting that the location's conditions could affect witness accounts.
   - A significant conflict arose during the interrogation discussion, where the defense argued that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect despite the witness claiming he was not. The defense challenged the rationale behind questioning him about his whereabouts and cult involvement without considering him a suspect.
   - The defense also pressed the witness on the lack of evidence found at a supposed cult meeting location, indicating a potential weakness in the prosecution's narrative regarding cult involvement in the crime. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's integrity and the evidence presented.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the area from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They emphasized that the tennis shoes collected did not provide any positive identification of Mr. Misskelley at the scene.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the interrogation process, implying that the questioning of Mr. Misskelley was part of a broader inquiry into potential suspects, despite the defense's assertion that he was treated as a suspect from the beginning.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implications.
   - The defense challenged the witness's understanding of the crime scene's geography, particularly regarding the elevations of the banks of the stream, leading to confusion about the layout and visibility from different points.
   - A significant point of contention arose during the interrogation discussion, where the defense argued that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect when he was questioned about his whereabouts and involvement in a cult, while the witness maintained that he was not considered a suspect at that time. This highlighted a fundamental disagreement about the nature of the investigation and the treatment of Mr. Misskelley.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?

COURT: Yes.

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of conflicts and disagreements regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there were inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly regarding the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene and the lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They emphasized that no positive results came from the analysis of evidence, such as tennis shoes, and questioned the legitimacy of the interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the thoroughness of the investigation and the legitimacy of the interrogation process, implying that the questioning of Mr. Misskelley was justified based on information received about a cult-like group and his potential involvement.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, which the defense used to question the thoroughness of the search.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, arguing that asking about his whereabouts indicated otherwise. The witness maintained that many individuals were questioned without being suspects.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult-related information that led to the interrogation, highlighting that no evidence was found to support the existence of such a cult or its members, which the prosecution had suggested was a basis for suspicion.

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's integrity and the basis for suspecting Mr. Misskelley, while the prosecution aimed to uphold the investigation's credibility.

P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the area from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They emphasized that the tennis shoes found were sent for analysis but returned with no positive links to the crime.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the interrogation process, implying that the questioning of Mr. Misskelley was appropriate and based on credible information regarding a cult.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implication that they were involved.
   - The defense questioned the credibility of the interrogation process, arguing that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect despite the witness claiming he was not. This led to a conflict over the nature of the questioning and the basis for considering someone a suspect.
   - The defense also challenged the prosecution's claims about the existence of a cult, highlighting that no evidence was found to support the allegations made by Mr. Misskelley regarding cult activities or members, which the prosecution had suggested were relevant to the case. 

Overall, the defense focused on undermining the investigation's integrity and the prosecution's claims, while the prosecution aimed to uphold the validity of their investigative methods and the information gathered.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of conflicts and disagreements regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the area from the service road, and the credibility of the interrogation process involving the suspect, Mr. Misskelley. They highlighted that no evidence linked Misskelley to the crime scene and questioned the basis for considering him a suspect during the interrogation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the interrogation process, implying that the inquiries made to Mr. Misskelley were standard procedure for gathering information about potential suspects and cult activities in the area.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implication that they were involved.
   - The defense and witness had conflicting views on the visibility of the interstate from the crime scene, with the defense suggesting it was possible to see traffic while the witness indicated it would be difficult from the creek bottom.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, arguing that asking about his whereabouts indicated otherwise. The witness maintained that many individuals were questioned without being suspects.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult-related information that led to the interrogation, highlighting that no evidence was found to support the existence of such a cult or its connection to Mr. Misskelley, while the prosecution did not provide a counter to this assertion during the exchange. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant tensions between the defense's attempts to undermine the investigation's credibility and the prosecution's efforts to uphold it.

P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

COURT: Alright.

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered.
   - The defense questioned the witness's understanding of the crime scene's geography, particularly regarding the elevations of the banks of the stream, leading to confusion about the layout and visibility from different points.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, arguing that asking about his whereabouts indicated otherwise. The witness maintained that many individuals were questioned without being suspects.
   - The defense also sought to discredit the notion of a cult involvement by highlighting the lack of evidence found at the crime scene that would suggest such a motive, while the prosecution did not provide substantial evidence to counter this claim. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the credibility of the investigation and the evidence linking their client to the crime.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?

54,54,97,Q/A,So y'all were looking into that --,Yes sir.,,DEFENSE,P_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a complex exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley. Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene. They highlighted that no positive results came from the analysis of evidence, such as tennis shoes, and questioned the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the cult allegations.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the basis for questioning Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the inquiry into cult activities was a valid line of investigation based on received tips.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implications.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, arguing that questioning him about his whereabouts indicated otherwise. The witness maintained that many individuals were questioned without being suspects.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult-related claims, pointing out the lack of evidence found at the alleged cult meeting site and the absence of corroboration for the names mentioned by Mr. Misskelley. The witness acknowledged the receipt of tips but did not confirm any cult-related findings at the crime scene. 

Overall, the defense focused on discrediting the prosecution's narrative by emphasizing the lack of evidence and inconsistencies in the investigation, while the prosecution aimed to uphold the investigation's integrity and rationale.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?

55,55,98,Q/A,-- that angle.,Yes sir.,,DEFENSE,P_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a complex exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley. Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the area from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They emphasized that no physical evidence was found at the scene to suggest a cult killing, despite claims to the contrary.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the interrogation process, implying that the questioning of Mr. Misskelley was appropriate given the context of the investigation into a potential cult-related crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting they were not present during the recovery of the bodies, while the witness confirmed city employees were there after the fact.
   - The defense challenged the witness's understanding of the crime scene's geography, particularly regarding the elevations of the banks of the stream and visibility from different locations, leading to confusion and differing interpretations of the scene.
   - The defense also contested the characterization of Mr. Misskelley as a suspect during the interrogation, arguing that asking about his whereabouts implied suspicion, while the witness maintained that he was not considered a suspect at that time.
   - Additionally, the defense highlighted the lack of evidence supporting the cult theory, questioning the validity of the information received and the absence of any corroborating findings at the alleged cult meeting site. The prosecution, while not directly countering this point, implied that the investigation was thorough and justified based on the tips received.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene where bodies were recovered.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking the accused, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene. They highlighted that no positive results came from the analysis of tennis shoes sent to the Crime Lab and questioned the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the cult allegations.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the context of the investigation and the presence of the accused at the police department during the interrogation, implying that the questioning was serious and relevant to the case.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the witness stating they did not see any at the time of recovery, which the defense used to question the thoroughness of the investigation.
   - The defense challenged the witness on the nature of the interrogation, asserting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect despite the witness's claim that he was not. This led to a conflict over the interpretation of the police's actions and the basis for questioning individuals about cult activities.
   - The defense also questioned the lack of physical evidence supporting the cult theory, pointing out that no findings at the crime scene indicated a cult killing, which the prosecution had previously suggested was a possibility based on anonymous tips. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's focus on the absence of direct evidence linking the accused to the crime and the prosecution's attempts to frame the investigation's context and the nature of the interrogation.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in a series of conflicts and disagreements regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the area from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They emphasized that no physical evidence was found at the scene to suggest a cult killing, despite claims to the contrary.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the basis for questioning Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the inquiry into cult activities was warranted based on received information. They aimed to establish that the police had a reasonable basis for their actions.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implication that they were involved.
   - The defense questioned the witness about the visibility of the interstate from the crime scene, suggesting that the dense forest would obstruct views, while the witness acknowledged that visibility would depend on the location within the creek.
   - A significant conflict arose during the interrogation discussion, where the defense argued that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect during questioning about his whereabouts and cult involvement, while the witness maintained that he was not considered a suspect at that time.
   - The defense also challenged the credibility of the cult-related claims, pointing out the lack of evidence found at the alleged cult meeting site and questioning the reliability of the information received by the police, which the prosecution attempted to defend as part of their investigative process.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the area from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They emphasized that no physical evidence was found at the scene to suggest a cult killing, despite the police's initial focus on that angle.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the basis for questioning Mr. Misskelley, asserting that he was one of several suspects based on information received about a cult-like group and his alleged involvement in it.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implication that they were involved.
   - The defense challenged the witness's understanding of the crime scene's geography, particularly regarding the elevations of the banks of the stream, which led to confusion about the layout and visibility from different points.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the interrogation process, arguing that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect despite the witness's claim that he was not, highlighting a potential inconsistency in the police's approach to gathering information.
   - Additionally, the defense pointed out the lack of evidence supporting the cult theory, questioning the reliability of the information that led to the investigation's focus on that angle, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was thorough and based on credible tips.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the area from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They emphasized that no cult-related evidence was found and that the police had not confirmed any of the cult claims made by the suspect.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the credibility of the investigation and the presence of potential suspects, including Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to highlight the information received about cult activities and the relevance of the suspect's statements during the interrogation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implication that they were involved.
   - The defense questioned the reliability of the investigation, particularly regarding the interrogation process and the basis for suspecting Mr. Misskelley, arguing that he was treated as a suspect without proper justification. The witness maintained that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect at the time of questioning.
   - The defense also challenged the existence of any evidence supporting the claims of a cult killing, while the prosecution referenced anonymous tips that suggested such a motive, leading to a conflict over the validity and interpretation of the evidence collected during the investigation.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the suspect's involvement in a cult.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene or to any cult activities. They highlighted that no positive results came from the analysis of evidence, such as tennis shoes, and questioned the credibility of the investigation regarding cult involvement.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that there were reasonable grounds to suspect Mr. Misskelley and others based on information received about cult activities and their potential connection to the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense and prosecution disagreed on the significance of the evidence collected and the interpretation of the suspect's involvement. The defense argued that the investigation lacked concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime or to any cult, while the prosecution maintained that the information received warranted suspicion.
   - There was also a conflict regarding the nature of the investigation, with the defense questioning the validity of the cult claims and the prosecution asserting that they were following leads based on tips received. The defense challenged the witness's assertions about the cult's existence and the suspect's alleged activities, emphasizing the absence of corroborating evidence.

P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene, particularly questioning the presence of search and rescue teams and the absence of any incriminating evidence found at the scene. They also sought to highlight inconsistencies in the police's treatment of Mr. Misskelley as a suspect during the interrogation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on the investigation's thoroughness, including the exploration of cult-related motives and the collection of information from various sources, suggesting that there were multiple suspects, including Damien.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense questioning the witness about who was present when the bodies were recovered and the timing of other personnel's arrival.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, arguing that asking about his whereabouts on a specific date implied suspicion.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult-related claims made during the investigation, asking for evidence of any cult activities or connections to the suspects, which the witness could not confirm.
   - The prosecution and defense clashed over the relevance of certain questions, particularly regarding the nature of the cult claims and the evidence (or lack thereof) supporting those claims. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to undermine the prosecution's case by emphasizing the absence of direct evidence linking the suspect to the crime and questioning the investigative process.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene, particularly questioning the presence of search and rescue teams and the absence of any incriminating evidence found at the scene, such as cult-related symbols.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that the investigation was thorough and that there were multiple suspects, including Mr. Misskelley, based on information received about cult activities in the area.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense and prosecution disagreed on the significance of the evidence collected and the interpretation of the suspect's involvement. The defense questioned the credibility of the cult-related claims and the lack of physical evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was valid and that Mr. Misskelley was one of several suspects based on the information received.
   - There was also a conflict regarding the interrogation process, with the defense suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect from the beginning, while the witness (Officer Ridge) insisted that he was not considered a suspect at that time. This led to further questioning about the basis for the cult allegations and the lack of corroborating evidence for those claims.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the suspect's involvement.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene, particularly emphasizing that no positive results came from the analysis of evidence, such as tennis shoes. They also questioned the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the alleged cult involvement and the basis for suspecting Mr. Misskelley.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the context of the investigation, including the presence of various officers at the crime scene and the exploration of cult-related leads. They aimed to show that the investigation was thorough and that there were multiple suspects, including Mr. Misskelley.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implication that they were involved.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, arguing that questioning him about his whereabouts indicated otherwise. The witness maintained that many individuals were questioned without being suspects.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult-related claims, highlighting the lack of evidence found at the alleged cult meeting site and the absence of confirmation regarding the cult's existence or Mr. Misskelley's involvement in it. The prosecution acknowledged receiving tips about cult activity but did not provide concrete evidence to support those claims. 

Overall, the defense focused on discrediting the investigation and the prosecution's claims, while the prosecution aimed to affirm the thoroughness of their investigation and the existence of multiple suspects.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**

     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.

   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.

   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene, particularly emphasizing that no positive results came from the analysis of evidence, such as tennis shoes. They also questioned the credibility of the investigation, highlighting that the police had not confirmed any cult-related activities or connections to the suspect.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the context of the investigation, including the presence of various officers at the crime scene and the exploration of cult-related theories. They aimed to show that the police were following leads based on tips received about potential cult involvement in the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the witness stating they did not see any at the time of recovery, which the defense used to question the thoroughness of the investigation.
   - The defense challenged the witness on the nature of the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, arguing that he was treated as a suspect despite the officer's claim that he was not. This led to a conflict over the interpretation of the police's actions and the basis for questioning individuals about their whereabouts.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult theory, pointing out the lack of evidence found at the crime scene to support such claims, while the prosecution maintained that they were following up on credible tips regarding cult activities. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's focus on the absence of direct evidence linking the suspect to the crime and the prosecution's attempt to justify the investigative process and the exploration of various leads.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene. They highlighted that no positive results came from the analysis of evidence, such as tennis shoes, and questioned the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the alleged cult involvement.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that the investigation was thorough and that there were multiple suspects, including Mr. Misskelley, based on information received about cult activities in the area.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense and prosecution disagreed on the significance of the evidence collected and the interpretation of the investigation's findings. The defense questioned the validity of the cult theory and the lack of concrete evidence linking the suspects to the crime, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was justified based on the information received.
   - There was also a conflict regarding the interrogation process, with the defense suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect from the beginning, while the witness (Officer Ridge) claimed he was not considered a suspect at that time. This discrepancy highlighted differing views on the investigative procedures and the treatment of potential suspects.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?

P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the interstate from the scene, and the lack of evidence linking their client, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They emphasized that no cult-related evidence was found and that the police had not confirmed any cult involvement.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the presence of potential suspects, including Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to highlight the information received about cult activities and the involvement of various individuals in the case.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered.
   - The defense questioned the reliability of the investigation, particularly regarding the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, asserting that he was treated as a suspect despite the officer's claim that he was not.
   - The defense challenged the existence of any evidence supporting the notion of a cult killing, while the prosecution referenced tips received that suggested otherwise, leading to conflicting narratives about the investigation's direction and findings.
   - The defense also sought to clarify the details of the crime scene's geography and the visibility of the truck wash, which the witness struggled to articulate clearly, leading to further confusion and conflict over the facts presented.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

COURT: Go ahead.

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.

Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.

P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking their client, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene, particularly questioning the presence of search and rescue teams and the absence of any incriminating evidence found at the scene, such as cult-related symbols or items.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to highlight the investigative efforts made by the police, including the exploration of cult-related theories and the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that he was a suspect based on the information received.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreement:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of individuals at the crime scene, with the defense questioning the witness about who was present when the bodies were recovered and the witness's recollection of events.
   - The defense challenged the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the cult theory, asking if any evidence supported the claims of a cult killing, while the prosecution maintained that they were following leads based on tips received.
   - The defense also questioned the witness about the interrogation process, asserting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect despite the witness's claims to the contrary, leading to a conflict over the interpretation of the police's actions during the investigation. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's focus on the lack of direct evidence against their client and the prosecution's attempts to establish a narrative of suspicion based on circumstantial evidence and investigative leads.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?

P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?","There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.",,DEFENSE,P_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a complex exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley. Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene, particularly questioning the presence of search and rescue teams and the absence of any incriminating findings at the scene. They also highlighted that the police had not confirmed any cult-related activities or connections involving Misskelley.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that the investigation was thorough and that there were multiple suspects, including Misskelley, based on information received about cult activities. They aimed to show that the police were following leads related to cult involvement in the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting they were not present during the recovery of the bodies, while the witness could not confirm their presence at that specific time.
   - The defense questioned the validity of the cult-related claims made during the investigation, pointing out the lack of evidence to support such allegations, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was justified based on tips received.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's assertion that Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, arguing that asking about his whereabouts indicated otherwise, leading to a conflict over the interpretation of investigative procedures.
   - Additionally, the defense sought to clarify the existence and whereabouts of individuals mentioned in connection with the cult, which the witness could not definitively confirm, further highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the investigation's findings.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?

     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**

   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.

     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the suspect's involvement.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene, particularly questioning the presence of search and rescue teams and the absence of any incriminating findings at the scene. They also highlighted that Mr. Misskelley was not considered a suspect during initial interrogations.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that there were credible leads regarding cult involvement in the crime, which included questioning the witness about the investigation into cult activities and the suspect's connections to such groups.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**

   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, arguing that questioning him about his whereabouts indicated otherwise.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult-related claims, pointing out the lack of evidence found at the crime scene to support the theory of a cult killing, while the prosecution maintained that they were investigating credible tips regarding cult activities.
   - The defense sought to clarify the existence and whereabouts of individuals mentioned in the context of cult activities, indicating a lack of concrete evidence to support the prosecution's claims. 

Overall, the defense focused on discrediting the prosecution's narrative by emphasizing the absence of direct evidence linking the suspect to the crime, while the prosecution aimed to uphold the theory of cult involvement based on received tips and witness statements.

nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene where bodies were recovered.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from nearby roads, and the lack of evidence linking their client, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They highlighted that no physical evidence, such as the tennis shoes sent for analysis, connected him to the scene.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the presence of cult-related activities, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was involved in a cult and that there were rumors linking him and others to the murders.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense asserting that they were not present when the bodies were found, while the witness could not confirm their presence at that time.
   - The defense questioned the validity of the cult theory, pointing out that no evidence was found to support claims of cult activities or connections to the crime, while the prosecution maintained that they were investigating leads related to cult involvement.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, arguing that asking about his whereabouts indicated otherwise. The witness maintained that many individuals were questioned without being suspects.
   - Additionally, the defense highlighted the lack of concrete evidence linking any suspects to the crime, while the prosecution suggested that rumors and tips indicated a broader investigation into cult activities. 

Overall, the conversation revealed a significant conflict between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to establish a narrative of cult involvement and suspicion surrounding Mr. Misskelley.

P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene where bodies were recovered.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking their client, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime scene. They highlighted that no positive results came from the analysis of tennis shoes sent to the crime lab and questioned the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the alleged cult involvement.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the presence of a cult and its potential connection to the crime, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was involved in cult activities and that there were rumors in the community about suspects, including Damien.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the witness stating they did not see any at the time of recovery, which the defense used to question the thoroughness of the investigation.
   - The defense challenged the witness on the nature of the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, arguing that he was treated as a suspect despite the officer's claim that he was not. This led to a conflict over the interpretation of the investigation's procedures and the basis for suspecting individuals.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult claims, pointing out that no physical evidence or confirmation of cult activities was found at the crime scene, while the prosecution maintained that they were investigating credible leads regarding cult involvement.

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's focus on discrediting the prosecution's claims and the investigation's integrity, while the prosecution aimed to connect the crime to cult activities and establish a narrative of suspicion around Mr. Misskelley and others.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the interstate from the scene, and the lack of evidence linking their client, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They emphasized that no cult-related evidence was found and that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial interrogation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the suspicion surrounding Mr. Misskelley and others, including claims of cult involvement. They aimed to highlight the information received about cult activities and the connections to the suspects.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered.
   - The defense questioned the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime and the absence of any physical evidence of cult activities at the scene.
   - The defense also challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, suggesting that asking about his whereabouts indicated otherwise.
   - The prosecution and defense clashed over the interpretation of the evidence and the implications of the information gathered during the investigation, particularly regarding the existence of a cult and its relevance to the case. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's thoroughness and the validity of the evidence presented.

P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the area from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking their client, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They emphasized that no cult-related evidence was found and that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial interrogation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the suspicion surrounding Mr. Misskelley and others, including claims of cult involvement. They aimed to highlight the information received about cult activities and the presence of rumors implicating Damien in the murders.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implications.
   - The defense challenged the witness's understanding of the crime scene's geography and the visibility of the interstate from the recovery site, suggesting that the conditions would have made it difficult for anyone to witness the crime or the suspects.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult-related claims, pointing out the lack of evidence to support the existence of a cult or Mr. Misskelley's involvement in it, while the prosecution maintained that they were investigating credible leads regarding cult activities.
   - The defense highlighted inconsistencies in the interrogation process, arguing that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper justification, while the prosecution defended the investigative methods used based on the information available at the time. 

Overall, the conversation revealed a significant conflict between the defense's portrayal of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's assertion of a legitimate inquiry into the crime and its potential cult connections.

P_WITNESS: No --",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the area from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They emphasized that no cult-related evidence was found and that the police had not confirmed any cult involvement despite rumors.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the presence of potential suspects, including Mr. Misskelley and Damien. They aimed to highlight the information received about cult activities and the relevance of the interrogation process.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered.
   - The defense questioned the witness's understanding of the crime scene's geography, particularly regarding the elevations of the banks of the stream, leading to confusion about the layout.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial interrogation, arguing that asking about his whereabouts indicated otherwise.
   - The defense also pointed out the lack of evidence supporting the claims of cult involvement, while the prosecution referenced tips received about such activities, creating a conflict over the validity of the investigation's focus on cult-related motives. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's thoroughness and the evidence linking the suspect to the crime.

P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?

P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

COURT: Yes.

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --",What information did you record during the interrogation?,How thorough were your notes regarding the interrogation process?,What led you to determine when to start recording the interrogation?,"{

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the area from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They emphasized that no cult-related evidence was found and that the police had not confirmed any cult involvement despite rumors.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the presence of potential suspects, including Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to show that the police had received tips about cult activities and that Mr. Misskelley was questioned about his whereabouts and potential involvement in a cult.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the number of people present at the crime scene and the timeline of events, particularly regarding when certain individuals arrived and what assistance was provided.
   - The defense challenged the prosecution's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial interrogation, arguing that questioning him about his whereabouts indicated otherwise.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult-related claims, pointing out the lack of evidence to support the existence of a cult or Mr. Misskelley's involvement in one, while the prosecution maintained that they were investigating all leads, including those related to cult activities.
   - The defense highlighted inconsistencies in the investigation process, such as the failure to record all questions asked before Mr. Misskelley was identified as a suspect, which raised concerns about the integrity of the interrogation.

P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the area from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking the suspect, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They emphasized that no cult-related evidence was found and that the police had not confirmed any cult involvement despite rumors.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the presence of potential suspects, including Mr. Misskelley and Damien. They aimed to highlight the information received about cult activities and the relevance of the interrogation process.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered.
   - The defense questioned the witness's understanding of the crime scene's geography, particularly regarding the elevations of the banks of the stream, leading to confusion about the layout.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial interrogation, arguing that asking about his whereabouts indicated otherwise.
   - The defense also pressed the witness on the lack of evidence supporting the cult theory, while the prosecution maintained that they were investigating all leads, including those related to cult activities. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's thoroughness and the validity of the evidence presented.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene, emphasizing that no positive results came from the analysis of evidence, such as tennis shoes, and questioning the credibility of the cult-related claims made during the investigation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to highlight the investigative efforts made by Officer Ridge, including the exploration of cult-related information and the presence of rumors implicating Damien in the murders, suggesting that there were multiple suspects and that the investigation was thorough.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - The defense and prosecution disagreed on the significance of the evidence collected and the interpretation of the investigation's findings. The defense questioned the thoroughness and validity of the cult claims, while the prosecution maintained that these claims were part of a broader investigation into potential suspects.
   - There was also a conflict regarding the status of Mr. Misskelley during the interrogation. The defense argued that he was treated as a suspect from the beginning, while Officer Ridge insisted that he was not considered a suspect until he admitted to being present at the time of the murders.
   - Additionally, the defense challenged the reliability of the witness's recollections and the investigative process, particularly regarding the lack of physical evidence supporting the cult theory and the absence of corroborating witnesses.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.

     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the visibility of the interstate from the scene, and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They emphasized that no cult-related evidence was found and that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial interrogation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the basis for considering Mr. Misskelley a suspect. They highlighted the information received about cult activities and Mr. Misskelley's alleged involvement in such groups.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting they were not present when the bodies were recovered, while the witness could not confirm their presence at that time.
   - The defense questioned the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the lack of evidence supporting the cult theory and the reliability of witness statements. The prosecution, on the other hand, maintained that there were reasonable grounds to investigate cult-related activities based on tips received.
   - The defense also challenged the interrogation process, arguing that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper justification, while the prosecution defended the actions of the officers based on the information they had at the time. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant discrepancies in the accounts of the investigation and the treatment of the suspect, with the defense focusing on the lack of evidence and procedural issues, while the prosecution aimed to validate their investigative approach.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?

P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**

     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**

   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that there was a lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene, emphasizing that no positive results came from the analysis of evidence, such as tennis shoes. They also questioned the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the cult allegations and the interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the presence of a cult-related motive and the involvement of Mr. Misskelley in the crime, suggesting that he was a suspect based on information received during the investigation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implication that they were involved.
   - The defense challenged the witness's assertion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the interrogation, arguing that questioning him about his whereabouts indicated otherwise.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult allegations, pointing out the lack of evidence found at the supposed cult meeting site and the absence of confirmed cult members linked to Mr. Misskelley.
   - The prosecution and defense clashed over the handling of evidence and the recording of the interrogation, with the defense highlighting gaps in the witness's notes and the timing of when the tape recorder was turned on during questioning. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's claims by pointing out inconsistencies and a lack of evidence, while the prosecution aimed to connect Mr. Misskelley to the crime through circumstantial evidence and witness testimony.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.",What verification steps were taken before making arrests in this case?,How did the police ensure the accuracy of information regarding suspects?,What measures were in place to confirm alibis or details before proceeding with arrests?,"```json

   - The defense challenged the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the interrogation process and the lack of recorded evidence prior to Mr. Misskelley being identified as a suspect. The witness admitted to not verifying Mr. Misskelley's alibi before making arrests, which the defense used to argue that the investigation was not thorough.
   - The defense also questioned the basis for the cult-related allegations against Mr. Misskelley, pointing out that no substantial evidence was found to support claims of cult activity or his involvement in it, while the prosecution maintained that rumors and tips justified their investigation into this angle. 

Overall, the defense focused on undermining the prosecution's case by highlighting gaps in the investigation and questioning the reliability of the evidence and witness testimonies.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.

     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from nearby locations, and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They emphasized that no cult-related evidence was found and that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during initial questioning.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the basis for considering Mr. Misskelley a suspect, highlighting the information received about cult activities and the connections to other suspects, including Damien.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting they were absent while the witness could not confirm their presence at the time bodies were recovered.
   - The defense challenged the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the interrogation process and the lack of recorded evidence prior to Mr. Misskelley's admission of involvement. The witness admitted to not verifying Mr. Misskelley's alibi before making arrests, which the defense used to question the thoroughness of the investigation.
   - The defense also questioned the basis for considering cult involvement in the case, pointing out the absence of physical evidence or confirmation of cult activities, while the prosecution maintained that rumors and tips had led to the investigation of cult connections. 

Overall, the defense focused on undermining the prosecution's case by highlighting investigative shortcomings and the lack of direct evidence against Mr. Misskelley, while the prosecution aimed to validate their investigative approach and the rationale for suspecting Mr. Misskelley and others.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**

     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.

     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.

   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They emphasized that no cult-related evidence was found and that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during initial questioning.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the basis for suspecting Mr. Misskelley, highlighting the information received about cult activities and the presence of rumors implicating Damien in the murders.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting they were absent while the witness could not confirm their presence during the recovery of the bodies.
   - The defense challenged the credibility of the investigation, particularly regarding the interrogation process and the lack of recorded evidence prior to Mr. Misskelley being identified as a suspect. The witness admitted to not verifying Mr. Misskelley’s alibi before making arrests, which the defense used to question the thoroughness of the investigation.
   - The defense also questioned the existence of cult-related evidence, while the prosecution maintained that they were investigating leads based on tips received, despite the lack of physical evidence to support the cult theory. 

Overall, the defense focused on undermining the prosecution's case by highlighting investigative shortcomings and the absence of direct evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime, while the prosecution aimed to validate their investigative approach and the basis for their suspicions.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?

P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime scene where bodies were recovered.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from nearby roads, and the credibility of the evidence linking the defendant, Mr. Misskelley, to the crime. They highlighted that no physical evidence connected him to the scene and that initial inquiries did not treat him as a suspect.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the evidence collected, including the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, which they argued was based on credible information about cult activities and potential suspects.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting their absence indicated a lack of thoroughness in the investigation.
   - The defense challenged the credibility of the interrogation process, arguing that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was standard procedure based on the information available at the time.
   - The defense also questioned the basis for the cult-related allegations against Mr. Misskelley, pointing out the lack of evidence to support claims of cult involvement in the murders, while the prosecution referenced tips received that suggested such connections.
   - Additionally, the defense highlighted inconsistencies in the witness's recollection of events and the handling of evidence, suggesting that the investigation was not conducted with the necessary rigor, while the prosecution defended the methods used as appropriate for the circumstances.

P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.

     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They emphasized that the police did not find any cult-related evidence and questioned the validity of the interrogation techniques used.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the presence of potential suspects, including Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to show that the police had reasonable grounds to question him based on tips received about cult activities.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**

   - The defense challenged the witness's claims about the visibility of the crime scene from the service road and the density of the forest, suggesting that it would have been difficult for anyone to see or hear anything from the interstate.
   - The defense also questioned the legitimacy of the interrogation process, arguing that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was thorough and based on credible information.
   - The defense pointed out that no evidence was found to support the cult theory, while the prosecution acknowledged that they had received tips but did not confirm any cult-related activities. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's focus on undermining the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's integrity and the evidence presented, while the prosecution aimed to affirm the legitimacy of their investigative methods and the basis for suspecting Mr. Misskelley.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**

     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.

     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from nearby locations, and the validity of the evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They highlighted that no physical evidence connected him to the scene and that the interrogation methods used were questionable.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the methods used to interrogate Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the information gathered was credible and relevant to the case.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting they were absent while the witness could not confirm their presence at the time bodies were recovered.
   - The defense challenged the credibility of the interrogation process, arguing that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi, while the prosecution maintained that the methods used were standard for gathering information from potential witnesses.
   - The defense questioned the basis for the cult-related allegations against Mr. Misskelley, pointing out the lack of evidence to support such claims, while the prosecution referenced tips received that suggested a cult involvement, indicating that they were following leads based on community information.
   - The defense also highlighted inconsistencies in the witness's recollection of events and the lack of documentation regarding the interrogation, suggesting that the investigation was not thorough or reliable. The prosecution, on the other hand, defended the actions taken during the interrogation as necessary to elicit a confession from a suspect. 

Overall, the conversation revealed significant tensions between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to uphold the integrity of their investigation and evidence.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.

     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They highlighted that no cult-related evidence was found and that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial interrogation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the methods used during the interrogation, implying that the evidence gathered pointed towards Mr. Misskelley’s involvement in the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting their absence was significant while the witness could not confirm their presence.
   - The defense challenged the credibility of the interrogation techniques used, suggesting they were coercive and led to a false confession, while the prosecution defended these methods as standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense questioned the lack of corroborating evidence for the cult theory, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was thorough and considered all leads, including cult-related tips.
   - The defense also highlighted inconsistencies in the witness's recollection of events and the failure to verify Mr. Misskelley’s alibi, suggesting that the investigation was not conducted properly, while the prosecution argued that the investigation was comprehensive and justified. 

Overall, the conversation revealed a significant conflict between the defense's portrayal of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's defense of the investigative methods and findings.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from nearby roads, and the validity of the interrogation techniques used on Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no evidence linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime and questioned the credibility of the cult-related claims made during the investigation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the presence of potential suspects, including Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to show that the police had reasonable grounds to question him based on information received about cult activities.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting they were not present during the recovery of the bodies, while the witness could not confirm their presence at that time.
   - The defense challenged the validity of the interrogation methods used on Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the techniques employed were manipulative and could have influenced his responses, while the prosecution defended these methods as standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense questioned the lack of evidence supporting the cult theory, pointing out that no physical evidence or confirmation of cult activities was found, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was thorough and based on credible tips.
   - The defense also raised concerns about the mental capacity of Mr. Misskelley and whether that was considered during the interrogation, which the witness denied was a factor at the time. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant tensions between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to validate their investigative procedures and findings.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?

P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from the service road, and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They emphasized that the police did not find any cult-related evidence and questioned the validity of the interrogation techniques used on Mr. Misskelley.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the presence of potential suspects, including Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to show that the police had reasonable grounds to question him based on tips received about cult activities.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered.
   - The defense challenged the witness's understanding of the crime scene's geography and the visibility of the truck wash and interstate from the recovery site, suggesting that the conditions could have affected witness accounts.
   - The defense questioned the interrogation methods used on Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the techniques employed were manipulative and could have influenced his responses, while the prosecution defended the necessity of these methods to elicit information.
   - The defense also pointed out the lack of evidence supporting the claims of cult involvement, while the prosecution acknowledged that they had received tips but did not find concrete evidence to substantiate those claims. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's focus on undermining the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's integrity and the treatment of the suspect, while the prosecution aimed to affirm the legitimacy of their investigative actions.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

Current Exchange:

P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?

P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from nearby locations, and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They emphasized that the police did not find any cult-related evidence and that Mr. Misskelley was not initially considered a suspect during the interrogation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the methods used during the interrogation, implying that the techniques employed were standard practice to elicit information from suspects.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting they were not present when the bodies were recovered, while the witness could not confirm their presence.
   - The defense questioned the validity of the interrogation techniques used on Mr. Misskelley, suggesting they were coercive and potentially exploitative, especially given his mental state. The prosecution, on the other hand, defended these techniques as necessary for obtaining information.
   - The defense also challenged the lack of evidence supporting the claims of a cult involvement in the murders, while the prosecution acknowledged that they had received tips but did not find substantial evidence to confirm those claims.
   - The defense pointed out that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and questioned the police's failure to verify his alibi before making arrests, which the prosecution did not directly address. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant tensions between the defense's portrayal of the investigation as flawed and the prosecution's defense of the methods used to gather evidence and interrogate suspects.

P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from the service road, and the validity of the interrogation techniques used on Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no evidence linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene and questioned the credibility of the cult-related claims made during the investigation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the legitimacy of the investigation and the methods used to gather information about Mr. Misskelley and potential cult involvement. They aimed to show that the police had reasonable grounds to question Mr. Misskelley based on tips and rumors circulating in the community.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense asserting that they were not present when the bodies were recovered, while the witness could not confirm their presence at that time.
   - The defense challenged the validity of the interrogation techniques, suggesting that showing graphic evidence and using diagrams were manipulative tactics that could have coerced a confession from Mr. Misskelley, especially considering his mental state. The prosecution defended these techniques as standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense questioned the lack of evidence supporting the cult theory, pointing out that no physical evidence or confirmed witnesses linked Mr. Misskelley or others to any cult activities, while the prosecution maintained that they were following leads based on community tips.
   - The defense also highlighted the failure to verify Mr. Misskelley’s alibi before making arrests, suggesting negligence in the investigation, while the prosecution defended the timeline and rationale behind their actions. 

Overall, the conversation revealed significant tensions between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to validate their investigative methods and findings.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.",What techniques were used during the interrogation to elicit a response from Mr. Misskelley?,How did the presence of disturbing materials (like photographs and recordings) impact Mr. Misskelley's state of mind during the interrogation?,Was there any consideration of Mr. Misskelley's mental state when employing these interrogation techniques?,"{

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They highlighted that no physical evidence was found at the scene to suggest a cult killing and that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the methods used, including the interrogation techniques employed to elicit a confession from Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to establish that there were reasonable grounds to suspect Mr. Misskelley based on the information received about cult activities.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense asserting that they were not present during the recovery of the bodies, while the witness could not confirm their presence at that time.
   - The defense challenged the validity of the interrogation techniques, suggesting that they were coercive and potentially exploitative, especially given Mr. Misskelley's mental state. The prosecution, however, defended these techniques as standard practice to obtain information from suspects.
   - The defense also questioned the credibility of the evidence and the basis for suspecting Mr. Misskelley, arguing that the police had not verified his alibi or the claims made during the interrogation, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was thorough and justified in its approach. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to uphold the integrity of their investigation and the evidence collected.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

COURT: Go ahead.

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and sought to demonstrate that the police's approach may have influenced his statements.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution's claims were less directly articulated in the provided dialogue, but they appeared to support the investigation's integrity and the methods used to gather information from Mr. Misskelley, including the use of techniques to elicit responses during the interrogation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting that their absence could impact the investigation's credibility.
   - The defense challenged the validity of the interrogation techniques used on Mr. Misskelley, arguing that showing him graphic evidence and using diagrams could have coerced a confession, especially considering his mental state. The prosecution, on the other hand, seemed to defend these methods as standard practice to obtain information.
   - The defense also questioned the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the alleged cult involvement and the lack of evidence supporting such claims, while the prosecution appeared to maintain that the investigation was comprehensive and justified based on the information received.

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the investigation's methods and the reliability of the evidence against Mr. Misskelley.

Recent Exchanges:
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?

P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?

P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.

P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from nearby roads, and the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no evidence linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime and questioned the validity of the interrogation techniques used, suggesting they may have coerced a confession.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on establishing the credibility of the investigation and the presence of evidence that could link Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They sought to affirm that the investigation was thorough and that the officers acted appropriately in their inquiries.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implication that they were involved.
   - The defense questioned the methods used during the interrogation, suggesting that the techniques employed (such as showing graphic images and using diagrams) were manipulative and could have influenced Mr. Misskelley's statements. The prosecution, however, defended these methods as standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense also challenged the notion that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial interrogation, arguing that asking about his whereabouts indicated otherwise. The witness maintained that many individuals were questioned without being suspects, leading to a conflict over the interpretation of the investigative process.
   - Additionally, the defense pointed out the lack of evidence supporting claims of cult involvement in the crime, while the prosecution acknowledged that they had received tips but did not find substantial evidence to confirm those claims. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant tensions between the defense's portrayal of the investigation as flawed and the prosecution's defense of its thoroughness and legitimacy.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.

     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the visibility of the crime scene from the service road, and the validity of the interrogation techniques used on Mr. Misskelley. They highlighted that no evidence linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene and that he was not a suspect during the initial questioning.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the methods used to interrogate Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the techniques were standard practice to elicit information from a suspect.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense asserting that they were not present when the bodies were recovered, while the witness could not confirm their presence.
   - The defense challenged the credibility of the interrogation process, arguing that the methods used (showing photographs of the victims and drawing diagrams) were coercive and could have influenced Mr. Misskelley's statements. The prosecution defended these actions as necessary to obtain a confession.
   - The defense also questioned the lack of evidence supporting the claims of a cult involvement in the crime, while the prosecution maintained that they were following leads based on tips received.
   - The defense pointed out that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and questioned the officer's failure to verify his alibi before making arrests, while the prosecution argued that the investigation was thorough and justified. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant tensions between the defense's portrayal of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's defense of their methods and findings.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime scene and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They emphasized that the police did not find any cult-related evidence and that Mr. Misskelley was not initially considered a suspect.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the methods used to elicit information from Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the techniques employed were standard practice to obtain confessions from suspects.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of individuals at the crime scene, with the defense questioning the witness about who was present when the bodies were recovered and the timing of other personnel's arrival.
   - The defense challenged the interrogation methods, arguing that showing Mr. Misskelley graphic evidence and using diagrams were coercive tactics that could have influenced his statements. The prosecution defended these methods as necessary to provoke a response from the suspect.
   - The defense also pointed out that there was no substantial evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to a cult or the crime, while the prosecution acknowledged that they had received tips suggesting a cult involvement but did not find concrete evidence to support those claims. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's focus on the lack of direct evidence against Mr. Misskelley and the potential issues with the interrogation process, while the prosecution aimed to validate the investigative procedures and the context of the suspect's statements.

P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?

P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation and interrogation of Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and sought to demonstrate that the police's approach may have influenced his statements.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on establishing the credibility of the investigation and the presence of evidence that could link Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They aimed to show that the police had reasonable grounds to question him based on information received about cult activities and his potential involvement.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered, contradicting the defense's implication that they were involved.
   - The defense challenged the methods used during the interrogation, suggesting that the techniques employed (showing photographs, diagrams, and recordings) were manipulative and could have coerced a confession from Mr. Misskelley, especially considering his mental state. The prosecution defended these methods as standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense questioned the lack of evidence supporting the cult theory and the credibility of the information received about Mr. Misskelley's alleged involvement in cult activities, while the prosecution maintained that they had sufficient reason to investigate this angle based on tips and rumors circulating in the community. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's assertion of improper investigative practices and the prosecution's defense of their methods and rationale for suspecting Mr. Misskelley.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level.

nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during initial questioning and that the techniques used to elicit a confession may have been inappropriate, especially considering his mental state.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on establishing the credibility of the investigation and the presence of evidence that could link Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They sought to demonstrate that the officers were following leads based on tips about cult activity and that Mr. Misskelley was indeed a suspect as the investigation progressed.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting that their absence could indicate a lack of thoroughness in the investigation.
   - The defense challenged the methods used during the interrogation, arguing that showing graphic images and using diagrams to provoke a response could have coerced Mr. Misskelley into confessing, while the prosecution maintained that these techniques were standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense also questioned the validity of the cult-related claims and whether any substantial evidence supported the notion that Mr. Misskelley was involved in such activities, while the prosecution pointed to the rumors and tips that led them to investigate this angle.
   - Additionally, the defense highlighted the lack of verification regarding Mr. Misskelley’s alibi and the absence of evidence linking him to the crime scene, while the prosecution attempted to establish a narrative that included Mr. Misskelley as a key suspect based on the information gathered during the investigation.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation and interrogation of Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and sought to demonstrate that the police's tactics may have coerced a confession.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on establishing the credibility of the investigation and the presence of evidence that could link Mr. Misskelley to the crime. They aimed to show that the police had valid reasons for their suspicions and the methods they employed during the interrogation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team at the crime scene, with the witness stating they were not present when the bodies were recovered.
   - The defense challenged the validity of the interrogation techniques used, suggesting they were manipulative and potentially exploitative, especially given Mr. Misskelley's mental state. The prosecution, however, defended these techniques as standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense questioned the lack of evidence supporting the claims of a cult involvement in the murders, while the prosecution acknowledged receiving tips but maintained that they were investigating all leads.
   - The defense also pointed out that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and questioned the police's failure to verify his alibi before making arrests, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was thorough and justified.

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant tensions between the defense's portrayal of the investigation as flawed and coercive versus the prosecution's defense of the methods and rationale behind their actions.

P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.

COURT: Alright.

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.

     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation and interrogation of Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the credibility of the evidence and the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no physical evidence linked him to the crime scene and questioned the validity of the cult-related claims made during the investigation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that Mr. Misskelley was a suspect based on his statements and the context of the investigation, including the alleged cult involvement and the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the bodies.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**

The defense questioned the witness about who was present when the bodies were recovered, while the witness's responses indicated uncertainty and a lack of clarity.
   - The defense challenged the interrogation techniques used by the police, suggesting that they were coercive and potentially influenced Mr. Misskelley's statements. The prosecution defended these techniques as necessary to elicit information from a suspect.
   - The defense also pointed out that the police had not verified Mr. Misskelley's alibi or the claims about cult activities, suggesting a lack of thoroughness in the investigation. The prosecution, however, maintained that they were following leads based on the information available at the time.
   - The defense raised concerns about the mental state of Mr. Misskelley and whether the interrogation methods could have unduly influenced his responses, while the prosecution argued that the techniques were standard practice in such investigations. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to establish a narrative of guilt based on circumstantial evidence and witness testimony.

P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.",What time was Mr. Misskelley picked up by Officer Allen?,What time did the interrogation begin?,What time was Mr. Misskelley placed under arrest?,"```json

101,101,150,Q/A,When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?,Yes sir.,,DEFENSE,P_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a complex exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley. Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation and interrogation of Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the credibility of the evidence and the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no physical evidence linked him to the crime scene and questioned the validity of the cult-related claims that were investigated.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that Mr. Misskelley was a suspect based on his statements and the context of the investigation, including the alleged cult involvement and the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the bodies.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene and the timeline of events during the investigation. The defense questioned the witness about who was present when the bodies were recovered, while the witness's responses indicated uncertainty and a lack of corroborating evidence.
   - The defense challenged the interrogation techniques used by the police, suggesting that they were coercive and could have influenced Mr. Misskelley's confession. The prosecution defended these techniques as standard practice to elicit information from suspects.
   - The defense also pointed out that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and questioned the police's failure to verify his alibi before making arrests, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was thorough and justified based on the information available at the time. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to affirm the legitimacy of their investigation and the evidence against Mr. Misskelley.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation and interrogation of Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the credibility of the evidence and the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no physical evidence linked him to the crime scene and that the interrogation techniques may have coerced a false confession.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that Mr. Misskelley was a suspect based on his own statements and the context of the investigation, asserting that the police had valid reasons to question him and that they were following leads related to cult activity.

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?

Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?",Yes sir.,,DEFENSE,P_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a complex exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley. Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and that the techniques used to elicit a confession may have been coercive, particularly given his mental state.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution's claim focused on establishing the credibility of the investigation and the evidence collected, including the presence of certain individuals at the crime scene and the information received about cult activities. They aimed to support the notion that Mr. Misskelley was a suspect based on the information gathered during the investigation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the timeline and nature of Mr. Misskelley's interrogation. The defense argued that he was treated as a suspect too early and that the methods used to extract a confession were inappropriate, especially considering his mental capacity. The prosecution, on the other hand, maintained that the investigation followed standard procedures and that Mr. Misskelley’s eventual confession was a result of his own admissions rather than coercion.
   - The defense also questioned the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the alleged cult involvement and the lack of physical evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene. The prosecution faced challenges in substantiating claims about cult activities and the reliability of the information received from various sources.
   - Additionally, there were disputes over the interpretation of the evidence collected, such as the significance of the photographs shown to Mr. Misskelley and the psychological impact of the interrogation techniques used. The defense suggested these methods were manipulative and potentially traumatizing, while the prosecution argued they were necessary to obtain a truthful confession.

Current Exchange:

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

COURT: Alright.

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?

P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and sought to demonstrate that the police's approach may have influenced his confession.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on establishing the credibility of the investigation and the evidence collected, including the presence of Detective Ridge at the crime scene and the interrogation process. They aimed to show that the police had reasonable grounds to suspect Mr. Misskelley based on the information received.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting that their absence could indicate a lack of thoroughness in the investigation.
   - The defense challenged the methods used during the interrogation, arguing that showing graphic evidence and using diagrams could have coerced a confession from Mr. Misskelley, who they suggested may have had a mental handicap. The prosecution, however, defended these techniques as standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense questioned the validity of the cult-related claims that led to Mr. Misskelley's interrogation, pointing out the lack of evidence supporting the existence of such a cult or any direct involvement of Mr. Misskelley in the alleged activities.
   - The prosecution and defense also clashed over the interpretation of Mr. Misskelley's behavior during the interrogation, with the defense suggesting that his fixation on the graphic evidence indicated fear, while the prosecution maintained that it was part of the investigative process. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to uphold the integrity of the investigation and the evidence presented.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?

In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and sought to demonstrate that the police's approach may have influenced his confession.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on establishing the credibility of the investigation and the evidence collected, including the presence of Detective Ridge at the crime scene and the interrogation process. They aimed to show that the police acted appropriately in their investigation and that Mr. Misskelley's confession was valid.

   - There was a significant disagreement over the timeline and details of the investigation, particularly regarding who was present at the crime scene and the methods used to elicit a confession from Mr. Misskelley. The defense questioned the reliability of the police's actions, suggesting that the techniques used during the interrogation could have coerced a false confession.
   - The defense also challenged the prosecution's claims about the existence of a cult and the evidence supporting it, pointing out that no substantial proof was found to link Mr. Misskelley or others to such activities. The prosecution, on the other hand, maintained that they were following leads based on tips received, which included allegations of cult involvement.
   - Additionally, the defense raised concerns about the mental state of Mr. Misskelley and whether the police considered his mental handicap during the interrogation process, while the prosecution defended their methods as standard practice in criminal investigations. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to uphold the integrity of their investigation and the evidence presented.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?

P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.",What evidence did you have to support the claims of cult involvement in the murders?,What specific findings did the investigation yield regarding the alleged cult activities?,How did the information gathered align with the allegations made by Jessie regarding cult involvement?,"{

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that no physical evidence was found to support the notion of a cult killing and highlighted inconsistencies in the police's approach to suspects.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the credibility of the investigation and the evidence collected, including the interrogation techniques used to elicit a confession from Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to establish that the police had reasonable grounds to suspect Mr. Misskelley and others based on the information received about cult activities.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense asserting that they were not present during the recovery of the bodies, while the witness confirmed city employees were there afterward.
   - The defense challenged the validity of the interrogation techniques, suggesting they were coercive and potentially exploitative, especially given Mr. Misskelley's mental state. The prosecution defended these techniques as standard practice to obtain information from suspects.
   - The defense questioned the timeline and details provided by Mr. Misskelley during his confession, arguing that the police had not verified his alibi or the claims he made about cult activities, while the prosecution maintained that the confession was credible and based on the information gathered during the investigation.
   - The defense also pointed out the lack of physical evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene, while the prosecution attempted to justify the investigation's focus on cult-related activities based on tips received. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to uphold the integrity of their investigation and the evidence presented.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and sought to demonstrate that the police's approach may have influenced his confession.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on establishing the credibility of the investigation and the evidence collected, including the presence of Detective Ridge at the scene and the information received about cult activities. They aimed to support the notion that Mr. Misskelley was involved in the crime based on his confession and the context of the investigation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense asserting that they were not present when the bodies were recovered, while the witness could not confirm their presence at that time.
   - The defense questioned the validity of the interrogation techniques used on Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that they were coercive and potentially exploitative, especially given his mental state. The prosecution did not directly address these concerns but maintained that the confession was valid.
   - The defense also challenged the timeline of the murders as presented by the prosecution, with Officer Ridge expressing surprise at Mr. Misskelley's claim that the murders occurred at noon, contradicting the established timeline of events.
   - Additionally, the defense sought to undermine the prosecution's claims about cult involvement by pointing out the lack of evidence supporting such theories, while the prosecution maintained that they were investigating all leads, including those related to cult activities. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant tensions between the defense's portrayal of the investigation as flawed and the prosecution's defense of its methods and findings.

P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?

     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**

     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.

     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to establish that the investigation was flawed, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the credibility of the evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime, and the methods used during his interrogation. They highlighted that no physical evidence connected Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene and that he was not considered a suspect during the initial questioning.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to affirm the legitimacy of the investigation and the methods used to interrogate Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the information gathered pointed towards his involvement in the crime, despite the defense's claims of a lack of evidence.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense asserting that they were not present when the bodies were recovered, while the witness could not confirm their presence at that time.
   - The defense challenged the validity of the interrogation techniques used on Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that they were coercive and potentially exploitative, especially given his mental state. The prosecution, however, defended these techniques as standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense also questioned the timeline of the murders and the credibility of the information that led to Mr. Misskelley's interrogation, arguing that the police had not verified his alibi or the claims made about cult involvement before considering him a suspect. The prosecution maintained that the investigation was thorough and that the evidence pointed towards Mr. Misskelley's involvement. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to uphold the integrity of their investigation and the evidence against Mr. Misskelley.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the credibility of the evidence and the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no physical evidence linked him to the crime scene and questioned the validity of the cult-related claims that were investigated.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that the investigation was thorough and that Mr. Misskelley was a suspect based on his own admissions during the interrogation, despite the defense's attempts to portray him as an innocent party.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the presence of individuals at the crime scene and the timeline of events. The defense questioned the witness about who was present when the bodies were recovered, suggesting that key evidence may have been overlooked.
   - The defense also challenged the interrogation techniques used, arguing that they could have coerced a confession from Mr. Misskelley, especially given his mental state and the methods employed to elicit responses.
   - The prosecution and defense clashed over the interpretation of evidence related to cult activity, with the defense asserting that no concrete evidence supported the claims of a cult killing, while the prosecution maintained that the investigation was warranted based on tips received.
   - Additionally, the defense pointed out that the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley regarding the time of the murders contradicted known facts, which the prosecution had to address in their case. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the defense's strategy to undermine the prosecution's case by questioning the reliability of the investigation and the methods used to obtain confessions, while the prosecution aimed to affirm the legitimacy of their findings and the suspect's involvement.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?

I mean, later on --",Tape Inspector Gitchell.,,DEFENSE,P_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a complex exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley. Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the credibility of the interrogation methods used on Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and sought to demonstrate that the police's approach may have coerced a confession.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on establishing the legitimacy of the investigation and the methods used to gather information from Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to show that the police had reasonable grounds to suspect him based on the information received and the context of the investigation.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the timeline and circumstances of the bodies' recovery, with the defense questioning the presence of specific individuals and the conditions at the crime scene. The witness's inability to confirm the presence of certain teams and the details of the environment led to conflicting narratives.
   - The defense challenged the interrogation techniques used on Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the methods employed (such as showing graphic images and diagrams) were manipulative and could have influenced his confession. The prosecution defended these techniques as standard practice to elicit information from a suspect.
   - The defense also pointed out that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and questioned the police's failure to verify his alibi before making arrests, while the prosecution maintained that the confession was a turning point in the investigation that justified the subsequent actions taken by law enforcement. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's portrayal of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's defense of their methods and findings.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.",What evidence do you have regarding the involvement of individuals named by Jessie?,What steps did you take to verify the claims made by Jessie about the cult?,How credible are the sources of information regarding the cult and its members?,"{

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the credibility of the witness, Officer Ridge, regarding the presence of search teams, the conditions at the crime scene, and the interrogation methods used on Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no evidence linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime and questioned the validity of the confession obtained during the interrogation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that Officer Ridge and his team had a reasonable basis for their investigation and the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, asserting that they were following leads related to a potential cult involvement in the murders.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with Officer Ridge stating he did not see them there, while the defense suggested they were involved.
   - The defense challenged the methods used during the interrogation, arguing that showing Mr. Misskelley graphic evidence and using diagrams were coercive tactics that could have influenced his confession. The prosecution defended these methods as standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense pointed out that Officer Ridge did not consider Mr. Misskelley a suspect initially, despite questioning him about his whereabouts on the day of the murders, which raised concerns about the legitimacy of the interrogation process.
   - The defense also highlighted that the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley during his confession contradicted known facts about the victims' whereabouts, questioning why this discrepancy was not addressed during the interrogation.

Overall, the conversation revealed significant tensions between the defense's portrayal of the investigation as flawed and the prosecution's defense of the officers' actions as justified and necessary for solving the case.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.
DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and sought to demonstrate that the police's approach may have influenced his confession.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on establishing the credibility of the investigation and the evidence collected, including the presence of Detective Ridge at the crime scene and the interrogation process. They aimed to show that the police had reasonable grounds to suspect Mr. Misskelley based on the information they received.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting that their absence could indicate a lack of thoroughness in the investigation.
   - The defense challenged the methods used during the interrogation, arguing that showing Mr. Misskelley graphic evidence and using diagrams to elicit a confession could have been coercive, while the prosecution defended these techniques as standard practice to obtain information.
   - The defense also questioned the timeline of the murders and the validity of Mr. Misskelley's confession, pointing out that he initially denied involvement and that the police had not verified his alibi before making arrests. The prosecution, on the other hand, maintained that the confession was obtained legitimately and was consistent with the evidence they had.
   - Additionally, the defense raised concerns about the mental state of Mr. Misskelley and whether the police considered his mental handicap during the interrogation process, which the prosecution did not acknowledge as a significant factor at that time. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to uphold the integrity of the investigation and the evidence presented.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.
DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.

     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.

     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and sought to demonstrate that the police's approach may have influenced his confession.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution focused on establishing the credibility of the investigation and the evidence collected, including the presence of Detective Ridge and the methods used to elicit information from Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to show that the police acted appropriately in their investigation and that the confession was valid.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the timeline and circumstances surrounding the recovery of the bodies and the subsequent investigation. The defense questioned the thoroughness of the police's search efforts and the lack of evidence found at the crime scene that would support the theory of a cult killing, which was a key aspect of the prosecution's narrative.
   - The defense also challenged the interrogation techniques used by the police, suggesting that they may have coerced a confession from Mr. Misskelley, particularly by showing him graphic images and using diagrams to provoke a response. The prosecution defended these techniques as standard practice in eliciting information from suspects.
   - Additionally, the defense pointed out that Mr. Misskelley's initial denials and claims of an alibi were not adequately investigated by the police before he was considered a suspect, raising questions about the integrity of the investigation process. The prosecution maintained that the investigation was comprehensive and justified based on the information available at the time. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's portrayal of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's defense of their methods and findings.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the credibility of the interrogation methods used on Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and sought to demonstrate that the police's approach may have coerced a confession.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution's claim revolved around establishing the credibility of the investigation and the evidence collected, including the interrogation techniques used to elicit a confession from Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to show that the police had reasonable grounds to suspect Mr. Misskelley based on the information they received.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting that their absence could undermine the investigation's thoroughness.
   - The defense challenged the methods used during the interrogation, arguing that showing Mr. Misskelley graphic evidence and using diagrams were manipulative tactics that could have influenced his responses. The prosecution defended these methods as standard practice to elicit information from a suspect.
   - The defense also questioned the timeline of the murders and the validity of Mr. Misskelley's confession, pointing out that he initially denied involvement and that the police had not verified his alibi before making arrests. The prosecution maintained that the confession was obtained legitimately and was consistent with the evidence they had.
   - Additionally, the defense raised concerns about the mental state of Mr. Misskelley and whether the officers considered his potential mental handicap during the interrogation process, while the prosecution did not acknowledge this as a significant factor. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to discredit the investigation and the prosecution's attempts to uphold the integrity of their case against Mr. Misskelley.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.
DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.
DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.",What inconsistencies exist in Jessie's statements regarding the events surrounding the crime?,What evidence or lack thereof supports or contradicts the notion of a cult involvement in the crime?,How credible are the claims made by Jessie about his involvement and the circumstances of the crime?,"{

     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.

     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search teams, the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley, and the lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They emphasized that Mr. Misskelley was not a suspect during the initial questioning and sought to demonstrate that the police's approach may have influenced his confession.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution's claim revolved around establishing the credibility of the investigation and the evidence collected, including the interrogation techniques used to elicit a confession from Mr. Misskelley, which they argued were standard practices in law enforcement.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting that their absence could indicate a lack of thoroughness in the investigation.
   - The defense challenged the validity of Mr. Misskelley's confession, questioning the methods used to obtain it, including showing him graphic evidence and using diagrams, which they argued could have coerced a response rather than eliciting a truthful confession.
   - The defense also pointed out that the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley contradicted known facts about the victims' whereabouts, suggesting that the police did not adequately verify his statements before proceeding with arrests.
   - The prosecution and defense clashed over the interpretation of evidence and the implications of the interrogation techniques, with the defense suggesting they were manipulative and the prosecution defending them as necessary for obtaining information from a suspect. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant tensions between the defense's portrayal of the investigation as flawed and the prosecution's defense of their methods and findings.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?

P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.
DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.
DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.
DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?

116,116,165,Q/A,"That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?",No sir.,,DEFENSE,P_WITNESS,"The dialogue presents a complex exchange between the defense and prosecution regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley. Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, questioning the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, the credibility of the evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime, and the methods used during his interrogation. They emphasized that no physical evidence tied Mr. Misskelley to the scene and questioned the validity of the confession obtained under potentially coercive circumstances.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that Mr. Misskelley was a suspect based on his own admissions during the interrogation and the context of the investigation, which included rumors and tips about cult activities. They aimed to support the narrative that the investigation was thorough and that the confession was obtained legitimately.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense asserting that they were not present when the bodies were recovered, while the witness could not confirm their presence at that time.
   - The defense challenged the methods used during the interrogation, suggesting that the techniques employed (showing graphic images and diagrams) were manipulative and could have influenced Mr. Misskelley's confession. The prosecution defended these methods as standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense also pointed out discrepancies in the timeline of the murders as stated by Mr. Misskelley, questioning why the officers did not address these contradictions during the interrogation. The prosecution maintained that the confession was valid despite these inconsistencies.
   - Additionally, the defense raised concerns about the mental capacity of Mr. Misskelley and whether the officers considered this during the interrogation process, while the prosecution did not acknowledge this as a significant factor. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to affirm the legitimacy of their investigation and the confession obtained from Mr. Misskelley.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the credibility of the evidence and the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no physical evidence linked him to the crime scene and questioned the validity of the cult-related claims made during the investigation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that Mr. Misskelley was a suspect based on his statements and the context of the investigation, asserting that the police had received credible information regarding cult activities and potential involvement of Mr. Misskelley and others.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene and the timeline of events surrounding the recovery of the bodies. The defense questioned the witness about the number of people present and the visibility of the crime scene from nearby locations, suggesting that the investigation may have been flawed.
   - The defense also challenged the interrogation techniques used by the police, arguing that showing Mr. Misskelley graphic evidence and using diagrams to elicit a confession could have influenced his statements, especially considering his mental capacity. The prosecution, however, maintained that these techniques were standard practice to obtain information.
   - Additionally, the defense pointed out that the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley regarding the time of the murders contradicted known facts, such as the boys being in school, which the prosecution did not adequately address during the interrogation. This raised questions about the reliability of Mr. Misskelley's confession and the overall investigation process.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?

P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.
DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.
DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.
DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.
DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.",What efforts did the police make to verify Jessie's alibi on June 3rd?,How did the police handle inconsistencies in Jessie's statements during the interrogation?,What steps were taken to confirm or refute the claims made by Jessie regarding his activities on the day of the murders?,"{

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the credibility of the evidence and the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no physical evidence linked him to the crime scene and pointed out that the police did not verify his alibi on the day of the murders.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that Mr. Misskelley was a suspect based on his statements during the interrogation, which included details about the crime that were not publicly known. They aimed to support the narrative that he was involved in the murders.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the timeline and details of the crime, particularly regarding when the murders occurred and whether Mr. Misskelley was a suspect during the initial interrogation. The defense argued that the police had not verified his alibi and that he was treated as a suspect only after he made incriminating statements.
   - The defense also challenged the methods used by the police during the interrogation, suggesting that the techniques employed (such as showing graphic images and diagrams) could have coerced a confession from a mentally handicapped individual. The prosecution, on the other hand, defended these methods as standard practice to elicit information from suspects.
   - Additionally, the defense questioned the lack of evidence supporting the claim that the murders were cult-related, while the prosecution acknowledged that they had received tips but did not find substantial evidence to confirm those claims. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's focus on the lack of evidence and the prosecution's reliance on the suspect's statements as a basis for their case.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --

P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: I guess you were pretty happy that, that he had given this statement.
P_WITNESS: That's a fair judgment, yes sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.

DEFENSE: I guess you were pretty happy that, that he had given this statement.
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.
DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.
DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.
DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.
DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.",What was your reaction to Mr. Misskelley's statement?,How did you feel about the evidence provided by Mr. Misskelley?,What implications did Mr. Misskelley's statement have for the investigation?,"{

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented conflicting claims regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the credibility of the witness, Officer Ridge, regarding the presence of search teams, the conditions at the crime scene, and the interrogation methods used on Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no evidence linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime and questioned the validity of the confession obtained during the interrogation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that Officer Ridge and his team conducted a thorough investigation and that Mr. Misskelley was a suspect based on the information gathered, including his confession and the context of the crime.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with Officer Ridge stating he did not see them there, while the defense suggested they were involved.
   - The defense challenged the methods used during the interrogation, arguing that the techniques employed (showing graphic images and diagrams) could have coerced a confession from Mr. Misskelley, especially considering his mental state. The prosecution, however, maintained that these methods were standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense pointed out discrepancies in Mr. Misskelley's statements, particularly regarding the timeline of the murders and the details he provided, which did not align with known evidence. The prosecution defended the validity of the confession, asserting that it was obtained after Mr. Misskelley had been identified as a suspect.
   - The defense also questioned the lack of follow-up on Mr. Misskelley's alibi and the absence of corroborating evidence for the cult-related claims that were part of the investigation, while the prosecution argued that they were exploring all leads based on tips received.

Overall, the conversation highlighted significant tensions between the defense's portrayal of the investigation as flawed and the prosecution's defense of the methods and conclusions drawn by law enforcement.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.

DEFENSE: I guess you were pretty happy that, that he had given this statement.
P_WITNESS: That's a fair judgment, yes sir.

DEFENSE: There was a lot of pressure on the police department to make an arrest, wasn't there?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the credibility of the witness, Officer Ridge, regarding the presence of search teams, the conditions at the crime scene, and the interrogation methods used on Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no evidence linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime and questioned the validity of the confession obtained during the interrogation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the confession made by Mr. Misskelley, suggesting that the techniques used during the interrogation were standard practice to elicit information from suspects.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with Officer Ridge stating he did not see them there, while the defense suggested they were involved.
   - The defense challenged the methods used during the interrogation, arguing that showing graphic images and using diagrams could have coerced a confession from Mr. Misskelley, especially considering his mental state. The prosecution defended these methods as legitimate investigative techniques.
   - The defense pointed out discrepancies in Mr. Misskelley's statements about the timing and circumstances of the murders, questioning why the police did not verify his alibi before making an arrest. The prosecution maintained that the confession was obtained legitimately and was consistent with the evidence.
   - The defense also raised concerns about the lack of evidence supporting the claim of a cult involvement in the murders, while the prosecution acknowledged that they had received tips but did not find substantial evidence to confirm those claims. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to uphold the integrity of the investigation and the confession.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.

DEFENSE: I guess you were pretty happy that, that he had given this statement.
P_WITNESS: That's a fair judgment, yes sir.

DEFENSE: There was a lot of pressure on the police department to make an arrest, wasn't there?
P_WITNESS: I'm not saying to make an arrest, to solve the crime.

P_WITNESS: I'm talking about several different areas, around and close to Lakeshore.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.

Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.
DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.
DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.
DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.
DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.
DEFENSE: I guess you were pretty happy that, that he had given this statement.
P_WITNESS: That's a fair judgment, yes sir.
DEFENSE: There was a lot of pressure on the police department to make an arrest, wasn't there?
P_WITNESS: I'm not saying to make an arrest, to solve the crime.
DEFENSE: Pass the witness.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the credibility of the evidence and the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that there was no direct evidence linking him to the crime scene and pointed out that the police did not verify his alibi before making an arrest.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that the investigation was thorough and that the officers had reasonable grounds to suspect Mr. Misskelley based on the information they received, including his statements about cult activities and his presence at the crime scene.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the credibility of the evidence collected and the methods used during the interrogation. The defense argued that the techniques employed, such as showing graphic images and diagrams, were coercive and could have influenced Mr. Misskelley's statements. The prosecution, on the other hand, defended these methods as standard practices to elicit information from a suspect.
   - The defense also challenged the timeline of the murders, questioning the validity of Mr. Misskelley's confession that the murders occurred at noon, which contradicted the established timeline of the victims being seen alive later in the day. The prosecution did not adequately address this contradiction during the interrogation, leading to further conflict over the reliability of the confession.
   - Additionally, the defense pointed out the lack of evidence supporting the existence of a cult and the claims made by Mr. Misskelley, while the prosecution maintained that they were investigating all leads, including those related to cult activities. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to uphold the integrity of their investigation.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.

DEFENSE: I guess you were pretty happy that, that he had given this statement.
P_WITNESS: That's a fair judgment, yes sir.

DEFENSE: There was a lot of pressure on the police department to make an arrest, wasn't there?
P_WITNESS: I'm not saying to make an arrest, to solve the crime.

DEFENSE: Pass the witness.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't have any further questions at this time.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, you're talking about Stonehenge, right?
P_WITNESS: I'm talking about several different areas, around and close to Lakeshore.

DEFENSE: How do you know that this isn't a bunch of kids getting together and playing loud music and, and drinking beer?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.
DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.
DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.
DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.
DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.
DEFENSE: I guess you were pretty happy that, that he had given this statement.
P_WITNESS: That's a fair judgment, yes sir.
DEFENSE: There was a lot of pressure on the police department to make an arrest, wasn't there?
P_WITNESS: I'm not saying to make an arrest, to solve the crime.
DEFENSE: Pass the witness.

In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the credibility of the witness, Officer Ridge, regarding the presence of search teams, the conditions at the crime scene, and the interrogation methods used on Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that no physical evidence linked Mr. Misskelley to the crime and questioned the validity of the confession obtained during the interrogation.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish the credibility of the investigation and the evidence collected, including the confession from Mr. Misskelley. They aimed to show that the police had reasonable grounds to suspect Mr. Misskelley based on the information received about cult activities and his alleged involvement.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the presence of search and rescue teams at the crime scene, with the defense suggesting that the investigation was poorly conducted and lacked proper support.
   - The defense challenged the methods used during the interrogation, arguing that the techniques employed to elicit a confession were coercive and inappropriate, especially considering Mr. Misskelley's mental capacity. The prosecution, on the other hand, defended the interrogation methods as standard practice to obtain information from a suspect.
   - The defense also pointed out discrepancies in the timeline of events, particularly regarding the time of the murders and the statements made by Mr. Misskelley, which the prosecution had to reconcile with the evidence presented.
   - The defense questioned the lack of follow-up on Mr. Misskelley's alibi and the absence of corroborating evidence for the claims made during the interrogation, while the prosecution maintained that the confession was a critical piece of evidence in the case. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's efforts to undermine the prosecution's case and the prosecution's attempts to validate their investigation and the evidence against Mr. Misskelley.

Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.

DEFENSE: I guess you were pretty happy that, that he had given this statement.
P_WITNESS: That's a fair judgment, yes sir.

DEFENSE: There was a lot of pressure on the police department to make an arrest, wasn't there?
P_WITNESS: I'm not saying to make an arrest, to solve the crime.

DEFENSE: Pass the witness.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't have any further questions at this time.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, you're talking about Stonehenge, right?
P_WITNESS: I'm talking about several different areas, around and close to Lakeshore.

DEFENSE: How do you know that this isn't a bunch of kids getting together and playing loud music and, and drinking beer?
P_WITNESS: I don't know that.

DEFENSE: Thank you. Pass the witness.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Alright. I don't have any further questions.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find out anything from talking to people to indicate they were being deceptive with you, when you asked them about their cult activity?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

Below is a summary of the facts discussed, categorized into different issues, highlighting the conflicts and disagreements.

### 1. **Recovery of Bodies**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the number of people present during the recovery of the bodies.
     - Asserts that city employees were present to assist after the bodies were removed.
     - Seeks to establish the distance from the service road to the crime scene and visibility of the interstate from the scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not directly contest the defense's inquiries but focuses on the details of the investigation.

### 2. **Witness Testimony and Presence**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Challenges the witness's recollection of who was present at the crime scene and the timeline of events.
     - Questions the witness about the density of the forest and visibility from the crime scene.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Does not provide substantial counterarguments but maintains focus on the investigation's integrity.

### 3. **Interrogation of Mr. Misskelley**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the legitimacy of the interrogation process, suggesting that Mr. Misskelley was treated as a suspect without proper verification of his alibi.
     - Highlights that Mr. Misskelley initially denied involvement and had a mental handicap, questioning the appropriateness of the interrogation techniques used.
     - Points out inconsistencies in the timeline provided by Mr. Misskelley and the evidence available.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Argues that the interrogation was standard procedure and that the officers were gathering information from various individuals, not just Mr. Misskelley.

### 4. **Cult Involvement and Suspicions**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the basis of the cult allegations and the lack of evidence linking Mr. Misskelley or others to cult activities.
     - Points out that no physical evidence was found at the crime scene to support the cult theory.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Acknowledges that tips were received regarding cult involvement but does not provide evidence to substantiate these claims.

### 5. **Evidence Collection and Analysis**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Questions the results of evidence collected, specifically regarding tennis shoes linked to Mr. Misskelley, which did not yield positive results.
     - Challenges the thoroughness of the investigation, particularly regarding the verification of alibis and the collection of evidence.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Maintains that the investigation was conducted properly and that the evidence collected was handled according to protocol.

### 6. **Pressure on Law Enforcement**
   - **Defense's Position:**
     - Suggests that there was significant pressure on law enforcement to make an arrest, which may have influenced the investigation and interrogation process.
   - **Prosecution's Position:**
     - Claims that the focus was on solving the crime rather than merely making an arrest.

### Conflicts and Disagreements:
- The defense consistently challenges the credibility of the investigation, the methods used during the interrogation, and the lack of concrete evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime.
- The prosecution defends the actions of law enforcement as standard practice while acknowledging the existence of rumors and tips regarding cult involvement but does not provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
- There is a clear tension between the defense's assertion of a flawed investigation and the prosecution's insistence on the validity of their methods and findings. 

Overall, the dialogue reveals a contentious legal battle focused on the reliability of witness testimony, the legitimacy of investigative practices, and the presence or absence of evidence linking the accused to the crime.","Previous Context Summary:
In the court conversation, the defense and prosecution presented their claims and engaged in conflicts regarding the investigation of a crime involving the recovery of bodies and the interrogation of a suspect, Mr. Misskelley.

1. **Important Claims:**
   - **Defense:** The defense aimed to highlight inconsistencies in the investigation, particularly questioning the credibility of the evidence and the methods used during the interrogation of Mr. Misskelley. They emphasized that there was no direct evidence linking him to the crime and pointed out that the police did not verify his alibi before making an arrest.
   - **Prosecution:** The prosecution sought to establish that the investigation was thorough and that there were reasonable grounds to suspect Mr. Misskelley based on the information gathered, including tips about cult activity and his eventual confession.

2. **Conflicts and Disagreements:**
   - There was a significant disagreement over the credibility of the interrogation techniques used by the police, with the defense suggesting that the methods employed (such as showing graphic images and diagrams) were coercive and could have influenced Mr. Misskelley's statements. The prosecution defended these techniques as standard practice to elicit information.
   - The defense also challenged the timeline of the murders, questioning the validity of Mr. Misskelley's confession that the murders occurred at noon, which contradicted evidence indicating the boys were seen alive later in the day. The prosecution did not adequately address this contradiction during the interrogation.
   - Additionally, the defense pointed out the lack of physical evidence linking Mr. Misskelley to the crime scene, while the prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence and the suspect's statements to build their case. 

Overall, the conversation highlighted the tension between the defense's focus on the reliability of the investigation and the prosecution's assertion of a solid case based on the evidence and confessions obtained.

Recent Exchanges:
DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.

DEFENSE: I guess you were pretty happy that, that he had given this statement.
P_WITNESS: That's a fair judgment, yes sir.

DEFENSE: There was a lot of pressure on the police department to make an arrest, wasn't there?
P_WITNESS: I'm not saying to make an arrest, to solve the crime.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, you're talking about Stonehenge, right?
P_WITNESS: I'm talking about several different areas, around and close to Lakeshore.

DEFENSE: How do you know that this isn't a bunch of kids getting together and playing loud music and, and drinking beer?
P_WITNESS: I don't know that.

DEFENSE: Thank you. Pass the witness.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Alright. I don't have any further questions.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find out anything from talking to people to indicate they were being deceptive with you, when you asked them about their cult activity?
P_WITNESS: That they were being deceptive? Just that they denied being a member.

Current Exchange:
DEFENSE: Did you have any reason to disbelieve them?
P_WITNESS: No sir.",jm_prosecution_1,Detective Bryn Ridge,"Detective Byrn Ridge testified about his search in the woods for the three missing boys, and the eventual discovery of the bodies","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.

DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?

DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.

DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?

DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.

DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.

DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan

COURT: Yes.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.

DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.

DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.

DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.

DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.

DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.

DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.

DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan

DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan

COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan

COURT: Alright.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.

DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.

DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --

DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --

DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.

DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.

DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.

DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.

DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.

DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.

DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.

DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.

DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.

DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --

DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.

DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.

DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.

DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.

DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)

PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan

COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.

DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --

DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.

DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.

DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.

DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.

DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.

DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.

DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --

DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.

DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.

DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.

DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.

DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan

COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan

DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.

DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.

DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.

DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.

DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?

DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.

DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.

DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.

DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.

DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.

DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.

DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.

DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.

DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.

DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.

DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.

DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.

DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.

DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
P_WITNESS: On that day we took the statement and everything he had told us, and we acted on it.

DEFENSE: I guess you were pretty happy that, that he had given this statement.
P_WITNESS: That's a fair judgment, yes sir.

DEFENSE: There was a lot of pressure on the police department to make an arrest, wasn't there?
P_WITNESS: I'm not saying to make an arrest, to solve the crime.

DEFENSE: Pass the witness.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I don't have any further questions at this time.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, you're talking about Stonehenge, right?
P_WITNESS: I'm talking about several different areas, around and close to Lakeshore.

DEFENSE: How do you know that this isn't a bunch of kids getting together and playing loud music and, and drinking beer?
P_WITNESS: I don't know that.

DEFENSE: Thank you. Pass the witness.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: Alright. I don't have any further questions.
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Did you find out anything from talking to people to indicate they were being deceptive with you, when you asked them about their cult activity?
P_WITNESS: That they were being deceptive? Just that they denied being a member.

DEFENSE: Did you have any reason to disbelieve them?
","DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE, how many folks were out there the day the bodies were recovered? Could you name the folks that were out there?
P_WITNESS: Name each and every person? No sir.
DEFENSE: How many people would you estimate were there?
P_WITNESS: During the search, or during the period of time when the body was, bodies were actually found?
DEFENSE: I assume that there were folks that were out there searching and then the bodies were discovered. How many were there at the actual site where the bodies were recovered, when that occurred?
P_WITNESS: Okay, when I got there I remember seeing Detective Sergeant Allen. Detective Lieutenant Hester, and Detective Burch.
DEFENSE: Were there also members of the Crittenden County Search and Rescue team present?
P_WITNESS: At the actual scene?
DEFENSE: Uh hmm (yes)
P_WITNESS: I didn't see any, no.
DEFENSE: Did they come up later after the bodies were recovered?
P_WITNESS: I don't think anybody came up after that.
DEFENSE: Isn't it true that the city sent some employees out to help you pump the water from the stream?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: So they were present at the --
P_WITNESS: After the bodies had been removed, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. May I approach the witness your Honor?
nan: nan
COURT: Yes.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Officer RIDGE if you could step down, could you point to the service road just off the interstate?
P_WITNESS: This is the south service road of Interstate 40 & 55.
DEFENSE: Okay. And that service road is how the patrons of the Blue Beacon Truck Wash get in and out, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Patrons, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. How far would you estimate, I know you can't give me an approximate, I mean an exact figure, but how far would you estimate from where the bodies were recovered here to the service road?
P_WITNESS: Okay, if one inch is forty foot, if I had a ruler I could tell you.
DEFENSE: Just give me your best estimate.
P_WITNESS: Okay. Probably some 450 feet. That's just an estimate at this point.
DEFENSE: 450 feet or 450 yards?
P_WITNESS: I would say feet, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Could you hear the traffic on the Interstate 40 and 55 as you were at the crime scene that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Could you see the traffic going by from the interstate?
P_WITNESS: If you were up on the high bank, yes sir.
DEFENSE: So if you were down in the creek bottom where the water was, you wouldn't have been able to see the interstate?
P_WITNESS: You may have gotten glimpses if they were just the right point looking up through the ditch but probably it would've been very difficult to see any traffic on the expressway.
DEFENSE: How dense was the forest at that time of the year?
P_WITNESS: It was May, that's a good growing time in our region the new leaves are really beginning to come out at that point.
DEFENSE: Could you see the truck wash from where the bodies were recovered, could you see the Blue Beacon Truck Wash?
P_WITNESS: It would've been difficult to make it out if it's not moving but because of the color of the Blue Beacon you could probably make out that there's something there.
DEFENSE: Thank you, no further questions.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
PROSECUTION: Detective RIDGE, did ya'll conduct a little experiment where somebody got down in the ditch and yelled?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: You didn't participate in that?
nan: nan
DEFENSE: I have another question, your Honor.
nan: nan
COURT: Go ahead.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: May I approach the witness?
nan: nan
COURT: Alright.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Looking at the elevations Officer RIDGE...
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: This side of the creek, or the stream as it said on the diagram, what direction is that?
P_WITNESS: This would be north. That direction would be east.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so the side of the stream where the truck wash is and the oxidation pond, would be the west side?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, west.
DEFENSE: Also west and...
P_WITNESS: North.
DEFENSE: Northwest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Um, which bank, if you're standing at the reference tree right there where the three trees are grown together, which bank on the stream is higher? The east bank or the west bank?
P_WITNESS: Okay, you pointed at this tree actually as being the three trees, that's the single tree that's at the top of the high bank. This is where the three trees are, so --
DEFENSE: Okay.
P_WITNESS: Which position would you rather --
DEFENSE: Let's go from this reference tree right here.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: If you're standing there beside that tree and you look across to the east side of the stream, is the bank on the east side higher? Or where you're standing higher?
P_WITNESS: Well sir, I don't understand exactly what you're saying actually. Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level. Alright there is a shelf on the east bank and you would be looking at the, you're at this high bank on the west side, you're looking to the east, you're looking at a shelf that's low.
DEFENSE: Well, I understand there's several different levels, because --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- the diagram shows the, um the flow level basin is 207.5. And the shelf elevation is 210. And then the high bank elevation, which I would assume would be the highest point on this side of the stream is 215. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: No Sir. It's not the highest point. That's the way the engineer calls the high bank is the level of ground that's on both sides of that point. It's the level ground. It's not the heaps of dirt that were used in order to drudge that ditch out or clean that ditch out at some time.
DEFENSE: Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the right to recall this witness to testify about some photographs of the crime scene at a later point.
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: I don't -- they can look at them later, I don't want to pass around tennis shoes. I don't have any further questions at this time, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: These, uh, tennis shoes, Officer Ridge, were they sent to the Crime Lab for analysis?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, they were.
DEFENSE: Did they come back with anything positive or anything linking Mr. Misskelley to the scene of the crime?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk about uh, the interrogation on June the 3rd. Um, some point Officer Allen picked up Mr. Misskelley --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that morning, brought him to the department about what time?
P_WITNESS: I think he picked him up at about 9:30.
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, your Honor.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to --
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Nevermind, he's going on. Nevermind.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: When did you begin to take part in the interrogation?
P_WITNESS: Uh, it was about, 10:30 I guess. I can look at the Subject Description form, the time is at the bottom of it when I walked into the room.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now when you walked into the room you begin to ask Mr. Misskelley questions about participation in a cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And you also begin to ask him about his whereabouts on May the 5th, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's it.
DEFENSE: So is it safe to assume that at this point in time Mr. Misskelley is a suspect?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: You mean to tell me, Officer, that you got him down at the police department you're asking him where he was on May the 5th and he's not a suspect?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, that's correct, he was not a suspect at that point.
DEFENSE: So you were just bringing in everybody off the street and asking them these same questions?
P_WITNESS: Brought in very many people off the street and asked them questions about their whereabouts to see if they could remember that date.
DEFENSE: And what happens if somebody couldn't remember, did that mean they're become a suspect, or...
P_WITNESS: Not necessarily, no sir.
DEFENSE: Well, tell the jury what the basis of this cult stuff is. You'd received some information, I assume.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we'd received some information that a cult-like group existed.
DEFENSE: Okay. And did you also receive some information that Jessie had been to one of these meetings?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And where was this meeting held?
P_WITNESS: Somewhere in the area of Turrell, is what I understand.
DEFENSE: Okay, were you ever able to locate this spot?
P_WITNESS: I was taken to a spot where it was supposed to have taken place, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you find any upside-down crosses, or anything that would suggest that this was a cult place, or, uh, what, anything. Did you find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Um, did that surprise you that you didn't find anything?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Now, later on, um, Jessie in this story that he tells you, he tells you several people were in this cult with him? Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Were you able to confirm any of these people as being members of this cult?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ask these people whether they were in this cult?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: Did you also find out that some of these people that Jessie were naming were, were possibly enemies of his --
P_WITNESS: I don't --
DEFENSE: -- people that he had conflicts with in the past?
P_WITNESS: I wasn't aware that he had had conflicts with them, no sir.
DEFENSE: Was there anything found at the crime scene to indicate uh, that this was a cult killing, any upside-down crosses, or carvings on a tree with 666, anything that would make this look like a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Well, sir, I'm not an expert on the occult-type killings.
DEFENSE: Okay. Well, didn't the police department receive some information and anonymous tips through America's Most Wanted that, and other tips anonymously that this was a cult killing?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, we had received information to that effect.
DEFENSE: So y'all were looking into that --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- that angle.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And so someone had told you that Damien was involved in this kind of stuff, is that a correct statement?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it is.
DEFENSE: So, is it safe to assume that Damien was your prime suspect at this point, on June the 3rd?
P_WITNESS: He was one of several suspects, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did you ever find any people who had ate dogs, or, or uh, cooked dogs or skinned dogs with Jessie, er, like he said in this story that he told you?
P_WITNESS: (makes breathing noise)
PROSECUTION: Your Honor, I think that would call for the officer to draw a conclusion about whether or not somebody ate a dog or not. I don't think it's a proper question.
nan: nan
COURT: Rephrase your question. You might ask him did he ever find anybody that he could confirm, or what have you. You're asking him, you're asking him to speculate on what he did find the way you phrased the question, so rephrase it.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Did you find anything, any confirmation whatsoever, that there was a cult or Jessie was involved in a cult.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I did.
DEFENSE: And, what is that?
P_WITNESS: Okay, a young man by the name of Ricky Climer, in another state, that is separated from this group --
DEFENSE: Okay, I don't want you to tell me what - what he - what this person has said, because there may be an objection to that later on. But anybody else, besides Mr. Climer?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, there were other people talked to.
DEFENSE: Now, um, this information about this cult meeting in Turrell, didn't find anything there?
P_WITNESS: No sir, I didn't.
DEFENSE: Did this person who told you about the meeting tell you about a certain individual who was there?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: What was that individual's name?
P_WITNESS: A Michael Shaun Webb.
DEFENSE: You ever been able to determine where this person is?
P_WITNESS: No sir, not yet.
DEFENSE: Have you ever been able to determine whether or not he even exists?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he does exist.
DEFENSE: But you don't know where he's at?
P_WITNESS: I know he's somewhere in Memphis.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now you testified earlier in a different hearing, Officer Ridge, that uh, there was rumors in West Memphis that were running rampant, that Damien, uh, was involved in these murders. Is that correct?
P_WITNESS: There were rumors that Damien was involved, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay, and those were pretty common throughout West Memphis and Marion?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Now, you stated that there was a time when you decided that it was important to turn on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: -- and record the, um, information that Mr. Misskelley was giving you. Why didn't you record anything up to that point?
P_WITNESS: (stammers a little) -- it wasn't discovered he was a suspect until he said he was there at the time of the murders.
DEFENSE: That's when you decided it was important to record all of it then?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Did you write down everything and every question that you asked him prior to turning on the tape recorder --
P_WITNESS: No --
DEFENSE: -- In other words, does your notes reflect everything?
P_WITNESS: Everything? No sir, it does not.
DEFENSE: Can you remember everything that was asked and answered?
P_WITNESS: Can't remember everything, no sir.
DEFENSE: Now, um, initially, Mr. Misskelley denied any involvement whatsoever in this, didn't he?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: Did he also tell you that he was roofing that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, he did.
DEFENSE: On June the 3rd, did you make any attempt whatsoever to verify this?
P_WITNESS: On June the 3rd, no sir.
DEFENSE: Prior to making any other arrests in this case did you verify that?
P_WITNESS: Before making other arrests? No sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. Now, um, Officer Ridge, the photograph that was just introduced into evidence depicting one of the boys' bodies, that was shown to Jessie?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And this was immediately prior to him admitting and telling you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Shortly before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. And also, this business about the circle with the dots in the middle and the dots on the outside, that happened right before he gave you this story about being present when the boys were killed?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And also this little tape recorded message from, from uh, with the little boy's voice on there, that was immediately before, uh, his admitting that he was present at the scene, is that correct?
P_WITNESS: Few minutes before, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why did you guys do that? Why did you do the circle, why did you do the tape, why did you, uh, show him the photograph?
nan: nan
PROSECUTION: Your Honor. Excuse me. Your Honor, Detective Ridge has testified that Inspector Gitchell did that. I think the appropriate person to ask why somebody did something would be Inspector Gitchell.
nan: nan
DEFENSE: Judge, he was there.
nan: nan
COURT: Well if he knows why, I'm gonna let him testify. If, if you really want him to answer that question, I'm gonna let him do it. If he knows why and...
nan: nan
DEFENSE: There had to be a reason to do that.
P_WITNESS: There are times when Jessie would not be talking, he's, he's getting slower with information, he's, he's telling us things that are just, it's over and over the same thing. Those techniques are used to evoke a response.
DEFENSE: So you did these things, you and Inspector Gitchell did these things, to invoke a response?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Invoke - confession.
P_WITNESS: Invoke a response, to keep him talking.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, uh, Mr. Misskelley has a mental handicap?
P_WITNESS: No sir, it didn't to me on that date.
DEFENSE: Do you have any special training dealing with people with mental handicaps?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: Did it ever occur to you that, that this was going to scare him, showing a picture of a body?
P_WITNESS: (sigh) That it would scare him? (sigh) I don't know, I guess he was scared into making a statement, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Did, uh, you think it was going to scare him when you uh drew this, or when Inspector Gitchell drew this circle and made this diagram? Did you think that was gonna scare him?
P_WITNESS: Not to scare him, no sir.
DEFENSE: Did you think this little tape recorded statement with the little boy's eerie voice, saying what it said, did you think that would scare him?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, I thought that probably would scare him if he was involved.
DEFENSE: And you did that to invoke a response.
P_WITNESS: Inspector Gitchell did that, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Tell the jury, if you would please, about this circle.
P_WITNESS: This circle?
DEFENSE: Can you describe it, please?
P_WITNESS: It's just a circle drawn on a piece of paper, there are dots on that piece of paper, when it's shown to Mr. Misskelley, then it was asked where on this circle he was. Was he inside with the people that everybody was looking for, was he outside? We asked him where was he.
DEFENSE: And he replied, ""I want out.""
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Officer Ridge, when you testified earlier that when he looked at the picture of the boy's body he was fixated?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Kinda frozen? He just sit there and looked at it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Is that indicative of fear?
P_WITNESS: I would think so, yes sir.
DEFENSE: How long was Mr. Misskelley at the station house that day?
P_WITNESS: That day? From about whenever he was picked up, at 9:30 I guess, until he was arrested that day.
DEFENSE: What time was he placed under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Uh, far as I'm concerned, he was under arrest when he confessed to these crimes.
DEFENSE: When he said he was present and watched Damien and Jason do it?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That's the point that you considered him under arrest?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Let's talk a little bit about what he told you. Um, I guess you were real shocked, because you testified at the earlier hearing that, that you were shocked, when he told you that the little boys were killed at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And why did that shock you?
P_WITNESS: I didn't feel that the murders took place at that time.
DEFENSE: And what evidence did you have before you to suggest that?
P_WITNESS: There was a window of opportunity when the murders could have occurred, which we had found was between 6:30 on the 5th of May until 1:30, or approximately 1:30 when the bodies were found the next morning on the 6th. Next, next afternoon.
DEFENSE: So you knew then, that the boys were in school that day?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: That'd be a fair statement. And you also knew that there were eyewitnesses who placed them near their homes, uh, at 6 or 6:30.
P_WITNESS: Near their homes, yes sir.
DEFENSE: Okay. So you knew then, that the murders couldn't have happened at noon?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: Why didn't you ask Jessie about that on the tape?
P_WITNESS: He was asked about that on the tape.
DEFENSE: When? I mean, later on --
P_WITNESS: Tape Inspector Gitchell.
DEFENSE: The second tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you were the one doing the interrogating on the first tape.
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: But you didn't think it was important enough to go into that while you had the tape recorder on the first time?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir, it's all important. It was important that we keep him talking, when you start contradicting somebody, then they stop talking.
DEFENSE: I guess you were also shocked when you learned that, uh, Jessie had stated the boys were tied up with a brown rope?
P_WITNESS: Yes sir.
DEFENSE: And you knew that wasn't true.
P_WITNESS: I don't know that at some point they weren't tied up with a rope.
DEFENSE: That's not the way the bodies were found, is it Officer?
P_WITNESS: No sir.
DEFENSE: After Jessie told you that, that uh, he was present and watched Damien and Jason kill these three little boys, did you ever make an attempt on June the 3rd to verify where he was at or what he had told you earlier? About not, about roofing that day, or being home that afternoon.
