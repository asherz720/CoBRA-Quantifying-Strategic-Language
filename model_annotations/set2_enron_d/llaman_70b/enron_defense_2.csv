Explanation:

* The witness's response does not commit to a direct answer, instead seeking clarification, which is why I rated the commitment level as 4 (No commitment made).
* I rated the truthfulness as 0 (Not truthful), as the witness's response seems evasive and may be an attempt to avoid a direct answer.
* The consistency with previous testimony is unknown at this point, so I rated it as 0 (Consistent), but this may change as more information becomes available.
* The response relevance is slightly irrelevant (3), as the witness is not directly addressing the question.
* The response clarity is slightly clear with hedging (2), as the witness is seeking clarification but not providing a direct answer.
* The outcome of this turn is in favor of the Questioner, as the witness's response raises suspicions and does not provide a clear answer.
* The reason for this outcome is a credibility attack on the witness (2), as their evasive response may indicate that they are hiding something.","The witness is attempting to deflect the question by seeking clarification, which may indicate a lack of commitment to a direct answer.

Explanation:
- **Commitment_value (4)**: The witness does not make a clear commitment to answering the question directly, instead choosing to reinterpret the question and claim they are not telling stories.
- **quality_rate (0)**: The witness's response does not seem entirely truthful, as they appear to be dodging the question rather than providing a straightforward answer.
- **consistency_value (0)**: There's not enough information provided in the transcript to assess consistency with previous testimony directly, but the witness's evasion tactic might imply inconsistency or an attempt to hide something.
- **relevance_rate (3)**: The witness's response is slightly irrelevant because it does not directly address the question about having a conversation to get their story straight.
- **manner_rate (2)**: The response is slightly clear with hedging, as the witness understands the question but chooses to deflect it with a statement about not telling stories.
- **outcome_value (Questioner)**: The questioner (prosecution) seems to have the upper hand in this exchange because the witness's evasion tactic can be perceived as suspicious or indicative of hiding something.
- **outcome_reason (2)**: The reason for this outcome is the credibility attack on the witness. The witness's evasive response undermines their credibility and suggests they might be hiding information, which benefits the questioner's case.","The witness seems to be evading the question by claiming they are not telling stories, which raises suspicions about their potential involvement in coordinating a narrative.

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:

* **Commitment_value: 4** - The witness's response (""I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses"") does not make a clear commitment to either a yes or no answer, which could be seen as an attempt to avoid providing a direct response.
* **quality_rate: 0** - The witness's hesitation and unclear response raise doubts about their truthfulness, suggesting that they might be hiding something or not telling the whole truth.
* **consistency_value: 0** - There is no clear indication of inconsistency with previous testimony, but the witness's evasive response makes it difficult to assess their consistency.
* **relevance_rate: 2** - The witness's response is slightly relevant to the question, as it addresses the topic of contacting witnesses, but the lack of clarity and commitment reduces its relevance.
* **manner_rate: 4** - The witness's response is unclear, with hesitation and a lack of directness, which makes it difficult to understand their intended meaning.
* **outcome_value: Questioner** - The prosecution appears to be gaining an advantage in this turn, as the witness's response provides an opportunity for further questioning and potential credibility attacks.
* **outcome_reason: 2** - The outcome is largely due to the credibility attack on the witness, as their evasive and unclear response raises doubts about their truthfulness and potential motives.","The prosecution seems to be gaining an upper hand in this turn, as the witness's response appears evasive and unclear, potentially indicating a lack of truthfulness or an attempt to avoid commitment.",4,0,0,2,4,Questioner,2,0,1,0,-1,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.5,-1.6075525396484938,-1.204723775829698,0.1432393970683851,-0.40282876381879573

Explanation:
- **Commitment_value (4)**: The witness does not make a direct commitment to answering the question about the $120,000 investment in Photophete and instead asks if they told Mr. Duncan about the situation, which avoids a direct response to the question posed.
- **quality_rate (0)**: The witness's truthfulness is questionable because they seem to be evading a direct answer, which could imply they are not being entirely truthful about their involvement or knowledge regarding the Photofete situation.
- **consistency_value (1)**: The witness's response appears inconsistent with their previous testimony or the line of questioning, as they are now introducing a new element (telling Mr. Duncan) that was not directly addressed in the previous questions.
- **relevance_rate (2)**: The response is slightly relevant because, while it does not directly answer the question about the investment, it attempts to address the broader context of the witness's actions and communications regarding the Photofete situation.
- **manner_rate (3)**: The response is slightly unclear because it introduces a conditional aspect (""Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan..."") that does not provide a clear, direct answer to the question about the investment.
- **outcome_value (Questioner)**: The questioner seems to be gaining the upper hand in this exchange because the witness's evasive response may raise more questions about their credibility and involvement in the situation.
- **outcome_reason (2)**: The reason for this outcome is the credibility attack on the witness. The questioner's line of questioning is aimed at establishing inconsistencies or potential dishonesty in the witness's testimony, which could undermine their credibility.","The witness seems to be deflecting and attempting to shift the focus, which may indicate a lack of commitment to providing a direct answer.

Explanation:

* The witness's response of ""I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston"" does not directly address the question, which is why I rated the commitment level as 4 (No commitment made).
* I rated the truthfulness as 0 (Not truthful) because the witness seems to be dodging the question and downplaying the significance of the code of conduct.
* The consistency with previous testimony is rated as 1 (Inconsistent) because the witness's actions (or lack thereof) regarding the Photofete investment and the code of conduct have been called into question.
* The response relevance is rated as 3 (Slightly irrelevant) because the witness's comment about ""form over substance"" does not directly address the question about the code of conduct.
* The response clarity is rated as 2 (Slightly clear with hedging) because the witness's comment is somewhat vague and open to interpretation.
* The outcome of the current turn is in favor of the Questioner (prosecution) because the witness's evasive response has highlighted their potential lack of credibility and commitment to the truth.
* The reason for the outcome is rated as 1 (Logical arguments are convincing) because the prosecution's questions have logically highlighted the inconsistencies in the witness's actions and the company's code of conduct, making the witness's evasive response less convincing.","The witness seems to be evading the question by suggesting that the discussion is focusing on 'form over substance', which may indicate a lack of commitment to providing a direct answer.

Explanation:

* The witness's commitment level is 4 (No commitment made) because they don't directly answer the question and instead express uncertainty and curiosity about the phrasing.
* The witness's truthfulness is 0 (Not truthful) because their response seems evasive and unclear, and they don't provide a direct answer to the question.
* The consistency with previous testimony is 0 (Consistent) because there's no clear inconsistency with previous statements, but the witness's evasiveness makes it difficult to assess consistency.
* The response relevance is 3 (Slightly irrelevant) because the witness's comment about the phrasing is not directly related to the question.
* The response clarity is 3 (Slightly unclear) because the witness's response is vague and doesn't provide a clear answer to the question.
* The outcome of the current turn is in favor of the Questioner because the witness's evasiveness and lack of clarity create an opportunity for the questioner to press for a more direct answer.
* The reason for the outcome is 2 (Credibility attack on other side) because the witness's evasiveness and unclear response undermine their credibility and create an impression that they may be hiding something.","The witness seems to be evasive and unclear in their response, which benefits the questioner.",4,0,0,3,3,Questioner,2,1,1,0,-1,0.0,0.5,2.0,4.5,-0.9210532344605248,-0.9866815319136112,-0.03440116446471243,0.0656282974530864

```
{
    ""belief"": ""The witness's response seems to be an attempt to contradict the prosecution's implication that selling property in Aspen was not a long, tedious process.

Explanation:
- **Commitment_value (2)**: The witness makes a beneficial commitment by stating 'Yes, it was...' which attempts to support their previous stance, but the brevity and lack of elaboration may undermine its strength.
- **quality_rate (0)**: The witness's truthfulness is questionable because the response seems evasive or lacking in detail, which might indicate an attempt to hide the truth or avoid a direct answer.
- **consistency_value (1)**: The response is inconsistent with the implication that selling the property was a straightforward process, as suggested by the prosecution's previous statement.
- **relevance_rate (1)**: The response is very relevant to the question being asked, directly addressing the issue of whether selling property in Aspen was a long, tedious process.
- **manner_rate (2)**: The response is slightly clear with hedging, as the witness provides a direct answer but lacks elaboration or conviction.
- **outcome_value (Questioner)**: The questioner seems to have the upper hand in this exchange because the witness's response does not convincingly refute the prosecution's implication and may have opened up further avenues for questioning.
- **outcome_reason (1)**: The outcome is due to logical arguments being convincing, as the prosecution's line of questioning has highlighted potential inconsistencies or evasions in the witness's testimony.","The witness's response seems to be an attempt to contradict the prosecution's implication that selling property in Aspen was not a long, tedious process.

Explanation:

* The witness's commitment level is detrimental (1) because they seem to be unsure or evasive about the listing date of the Aspen property, which could imply that they are hiding something.
* The witness's truthfulness is rated as 0 (not truthful) because they initially stated that selling the property was a long, tedious process, but it was later revealed that the property was listed for $10 million and could have been sold relatively quickly.
* The consistency with previous testimony is rated as 1 (inconsistent) because the witness's current response about the listing date of the Aspen property seems to contradict their previous statement about the property being difficult to sell.
* The response relevance is rated as 2 (slightly relevant) because the question about the listing date of the Aspen property is related to the topic of the witness's financial transactions, but it's not directly related to the main issue at hand.
* The response clarity is rated as 3 (slightly unclear) because the witness's response is hedged with phrases like ""I'm not sure exactly"" and ""it was certainly after the bankruptcy"", which makes it difficult to understand their point.
* The outcome of the current turn is in favor of the questioner because the witness's evasive and unclear response has raised more questions than answers, and has potentially damaged their credibility.

Here's a brief explanation of my evaluation:

* Commitment level: The witness is making a beneficial commitment by providing a plausible explanation for the quick sale of the property, but this commitment is not detrimental to the witness.
* Truthfulness: The witness's response appears to be truthful, but the questioner has raised some doubts about the witness's credibility.
* Consistency: The witness's response is consistent with their previous testimony, but the questioner has highlighted some inconsistencies in the witness's story.
* Relevance: The witness's response is very relevant to the question being asked.
* Clarity: The witness's response is slightly clear with some hedging, as they provide some additional context and explanations.
* Outcome: The questioner appears to be winning this turn, as they have been able to highlight some potential inconsistencies and misrepresentations in the witness's testimony.
* Outcome reason: The questioner's logical arguments and fact-based questions are convincing, and they have been able to undermine the witness's credibility.","The witness seems to be providing a plausible explanation for the quick sale of the Aspen property, but the questioner has been able to highlight some inconsistencies and potential misrepresentations in the witness's previous testimony, which may undermine the witness's credibility.",2,1,0,1,2,Questioner,1,0,0,0,-1,1.0,0.0,4.4,8.78,-0.09725406823496192,-0.6756079305933272,-0.7483274675623703,0.5783538623583653

Here's a brief explanation of my evaluation:

* **Commitment_value**: The witness's response of ""Yes"" to the question about receiving the full asking price for the Aspen property is a detrimental commitment, as it undermines their earlier claim and benefits the questioner.
* **quality_rate**: I rate the witness's truthfulness as 0, as their earlier claim about the difficulty of selling the property is contradicted by the fact that it was sold quickly and for the full asking price.
* **consistency_value**: The witness's response is inconsistent with their earlier testimony, which claimed that selling the property would be a long and tedious process.
* **relevance_rate**: The question and response are very relevant to the topic at hand, which is the witness's financial dealings and potential motivations.
* **manner_rate**: The witness's response is very clear, as they simply answer ""Yes"" to the question.
* **outcome_value**: The questioner (prosecution) is winning this exchange, as they are able to highlight inconsistencies in the witness's testimony and undermine their credibility.
* **outcome_reason**: The reason for the questioner's success is the logical argument they are making, which is that the witness's actions and testimony are inconsistent and suggest potential wrongdoing.","The prosecution is gaining the upper hand in this exchange, as the witness's responses are becoming increasingly defensive and less convincing.

{
    ""belief"": ""The prosecution is gaining the upper hand in this cross-examination, as the witness's responses are becoming increasingly evasive and inconsistent.

Explanation:

* Commitment level: 1 (Detrimental commitment) - The witness's response (""That appears to be, yes"") implies that they are acknowledging the margin call, which could be detrimental to their case.
* Truthfulness: 0 (Not truthful) - The witness's previous claims of confidence in Enron's stock price and their decision to sell stock while telling employees to buy more are inconsistent with their current admission of receiving a margin call.
* Consistency: 1 (Inconsistent) - The witness's response is inconsistent with their previous testimony, which claimed that they were buying stock and had confidence in Enron's future.
* Relevance: 1 (Very relevant) - The question about the margin call is highly relevant to the case, as it suggests that the witness was under financial pressure to sell their stock.
* Clarity: 2 (Slightly clear with hedging) - The witness's response is somewhat clear, but the phrase ""That appears to be, yes"" is slightly hedged, implying that they are not entirely certain or committed to the answer.
* Outcome: Questioner - The prosecution is gaining the upper hand in this cross-examination, as the witness's responses are becoming increasingly evasive and inconsistent.
* Outcome reason: 1 (Logical arguments are convincing) - The prosecution's questions are based on logical arguments and evidence, which are convincing and undermine the witness's credibility.","The prosecution is gaining the upper hand in this cross-examination, as the witness's responses are becoming increasingly evasive and inconsistent.

* The witness's truthfulness is rated as 0 (not truthful) because their response seems evasive and unclear, and they may be hiding something.
* The consistency with previous testimony is rated as 1 (inconsistent) because the witness's response does not align with their previous statements about their financial situation and decisions.
* The response relevance is rated as 3 (slightly irrelevant) because the witness's statement about their general practice of borrowing from Enron does not directly address the question about selling $4 million of Enron stock in response to a margin call.
* The response clarity is rated as 3 (slightly unclear) because the witness's statement is vague and does not provide a clear answer to the question.
* The outcome of the current turn is in favor of the questioner because the witness's response seems evasive and unclear, which may raise suspicions and undermine their credibility.
* The reason for the outcome is rated as 1 (logical arguments are convincing) because the questioner's line of questioning is logical and effective in highlighting the witness's potential inconsistencies and evasions.","The witness's response seems evasive and unclear, which benefits the questioner.

Explanation:
- **Commitment_value (1)**: The witness's response, ""Apparently not,"" can be seen as detrimental because it implies that the sale of $4 million in stock was not entirely necessary based on the margin call, potentially undermining the witness's previous justification for the sale.
- **quality_rate (0)**: The witness's truthfulness is questionable because the response seems to avoid a direct acknowledgment of the discrepancy between the amount sold and the margin call amount, suggesting an attempt to obscure the truth.
- **consistency_value (1)**: The response is inconsistent with the witness's previous testimony about the necessity of selling the stock due to the margin call, as it now appears that not all of the $4 million was needed to cover the call.
- **relevance_rate (1)**: The response is very relevant to the question about the margin call and the sale of Enron stock, as it directly addresses the issue of whether the full amount sold was necessary.
- **manner_rate (2)**: The clarity of the response is slightly clear with hedging, as the witness uses ""Apparently not"" instead of a direct ""No,"" which might indicate some hesitation or attempt to soften the impact of the admission.
- **outcome_value (Questioner)**: The questioner (prosecution) appears to have the upper hand in this exchange because they have successfully highlighted a potential inconsistency in the witness's actions and testimony, which could erode the witness's credibility.
- **outcome_reason (1)**: The reason for this outcome is the logical argument presented by the questioner, which exposes a discrepancy in the witness's story and challenges the justification for selling a large amount of stock.","The prosecution has presented a strong case by highlighting the inconsistency in the witness's actions and testimony, specifically regarding the sale of Enron stock and the margin call.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?

This evaluation is based on the following reasoning:

- **Commitment level (4)**: The witness's response of ""Well, apparently"" does not commit to a clear answer regarding the availability of borrowing options, which benefits the questioner by highlighting the witness's evasiveness.
  
- **Truthfulness (0)**: The witness's vague response and lack of direct answer suggest a lack of truthfulness or an attempt to avoid providing a clear answer, which undermines their credibility.
  
- **Consistency (0)**: The witness's current response is consistent with their previous pattern of evasive or unclear answers, particularly when faced with direct questions about their financial dealings and decisions.
  
- **Relevance (3)**: The response is slightly irrelevant because it does not directly address the question about the availability of borrowing options to satisfy the margin call, instead providing a non-committal acknowledgment.
  
- **Clarity (4)**: The response is unclear because it lacks specificity and does not provide a direct answer to the question, making it difficult to understand the witness's position or reasoning.
  
- **Outcome (Questioner)**: The questioner is the winner of this turn because they have successfully highlighted the witness's lack of clarity, commitment, and potentially their lack of truthfulness, which can impact the witness's credibility and the overall case.
  
- **Outcome Reason (1)**: The reason for this outcome is the convincing logical argument presented by the questioner, which exposes inconsistencies and evasiveness in the witness's testimony, thereby undermining their credibility and supporting the questioner's line of inquiry.","The prosecution is more convincing in this turn because the witness's response of 'Well, apparently' indicates a lack of commitment and clarity, while also being slightly irrelevant to the question asked.

Explanation:
- The witness's response of ""I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?"" indicates a lack of commitment to answering the question directly, as they are seeking clarification rather than providing a straightforward response. This is why the commitment level is rated as 4 (No commitment made).
- The truthfulness of the witness in this turn is rated as 0 (Not truthful) because the question about the email seems to be a genuine inquiry, but it also serves as a way to sidestep the main issue at hand, which is about the witness's choices on July 26th and the availability of other lines of credit.
- The consistency with previous testimony is also rated as 0 (Consistent) because there is no direct inconsistency with previous statements, but the evasion tactic itself may raise questions about the witness's overall credibility and consistency in their testimony.
- The response relevance is rated as 3 (Slightly irrelevant) because, while the question about the email is related to the context of the conversation, it does not directly address the question posed by the prosecutor about the witness's choices on July 26th.
- The response clarity is rated as 3 (Slightly unclear) because the witness's question about the email introduces a bit of confusion and does not provide a clear, direct answer to the prosecutor's question.
- The outcome of this turn is in favor of the Questioner (prosecutor) because the witness's evasion tactic may make them appear less credible or cooperative, potentially benefiting the prosecutor's case by highlighting the witness's reluctance to address certain topics directly.
- The reason for this outcome is rated as 1 (Logical arguments are convincing) because the prosecutor's line of questioning is designed to highlight inconsistencies or evasions in the witness's testimony, using logical arguments to challenge the witness's credibility and version of events.","The witness seems to be evading the question by asking for clarification on the email from Mr. Herrold, which suggests a lack of commitment to providing a direct answer.

{
    ""belief"": ""The prosecution is more convincing in this turn as they have presented evidence that contradicts the witness's previous statements and have highlighted inconsistencies in their testimony."",
    ""Commitment_value"": ""1"",

    ""outcome_value"": ""Questioner"",
    ""outcome_reason"": ""1""
}
```

Explanation:
- **Commitment_value (1)**: The witness's response (""Yes"") can be seen as a detrimental commitment because it acknowledges a piece of information (the May 2001 email from Mr. Herrold) that the prosecution can use to further question the witness's actions and decisions, potentially benefiting the questioner.
- **quality_rate (0)**: The witness's truthfulness is questionable given the inconsistencies highlighted by the prosecution in their previous testimony, suggesting that the witness might not be entirely truthful.
- **consistency_value (1)**: The witness's current response is inconsistent with their previous statements, as highlighted by the prosecution, indicating a lack of consistency.
- **relevance_rate (1)**: The witness's response is very relevant to the question being asked, as it directly addresses the email from Mr. Herrold and the witness's knowledge of it.
- **manner_rate (2)**: The response is slightly clear with hedging, as the witness simply acknowledges the email without providing additional context or clarification, which might be seen as slightly unclear but still conveys the necessary information.
- **outcome_value (Questioner)**: The outcome of this turn favors the questioner (prosecution) because they have successfully highlighted inconsistencies and potentially damaging information about the witness's actions.
- **outcome_reason (1)**: The reason for this outcome is the logical arguments presented by the prosecution, which convincingly show discrepancies in the witness's testimony and actions, making their case stronger.",The prosecution is more convincing in this turn as they have presented evidence that contradicts the witness's previous statements and have highlighted inconsistencies in their testimony.,1,0,1,1,2,Questioner,1,0,0,0,-1,0.0,2.24,6.2,25.58,0.52059530643421,0.5454286353367594,-0.02329528252554457,-0.024833328902549412

But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

PROSECUTION: Remember the May, 2001, e-mail from Mr. Herrold advising you of a choice between accessing money from other lines of credit or selling back
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: – Enron stock?
","Based on the provided transcript, here's the evaluation of the witness's current response:

```
{
    ""belief"": ""The prosecution is more convincing in this turn as they have presented evidence that contradicts the witness's previous statements, making the witness's responses seem less credible."",
    ""Commitment_value"": ""1"",
    ""quality_rate"": ""0"",

    ""outcome_value"": ""Questioner"",

}
```

Explanation:
- The witness's commitment level is detrimental (1) because their response (""Yes"") acknowledges a fact that can be used against them, implying they had other options to meet the margin call instead of selling Enron stock.
- The witness's truthfulness is rated as not truthful (0) because their previous statements about not having options to meet the margin call are contradicted by the evidence presented by the prosecution.
- The consistency with previous testimony is rated as inconsistent (1) because the witness's current response contradicts their earlier statements about their financial situation and options.
- The response relevance is very relevant (1) as it directly addresses the question and provides information crucial to understanding the witness's actions.
- The response clarity is very clear (1) because the witness's answer is direct and unambiguous.
- The outcome of this turn favors the questioner (prosecution) because they have successfully highlighted inconsistencies in the witness's testimony and presented evidence that undermines the witness's credibility.
- The reason for this outcome is the convincing logical arguments (1) presented by the prosecution, which expose contradictions in the witness's story and challenge their credibility.","The prosecution is more convincing in this turn as they have presented evidence that contradicts the witness's previous statements, making the witness's responses seem less credible.",1,0,1,1,1,Questioner,1,0,0,0,-1,0.0,2.24,6.2,27.82,0.52059530643421,0.7082335107941045,-0.1526967806493356,-0.18763820435989442

Explanation:
- The witness's commitment level is detrimental (1) because their response acknowledges the availability of other options, which undermines their earlier defense.
- The witness's truthfulness is rated as not truthful (0) because their current response is inconsistent with their earlier testimony, suggesting they may have been misleading about their financial situation.
- The consistency with previous testimony is rated as inconsistent (1) because the witness's current response contradicts their earlier statement about being forced to sell Enron stock.
- The response relevance is very relevant (1) because it directly addresses the question about the witness's options for meeting the margin call.
- The response clarity is slightly clear with hedging (2) because the witness uses phrases like ""That appears to be so,"" which may indicate some uncertainty or evasion.
- The outcome of the current turn is in favor of the questioner (prosecution) because the witness's response has weakened their defense and raised further questions about their credibility.
- The reason for the outcome is logical arguments are convincing (1) because the prosecution has presented a clear and logical case that the witness had other options available to meet the margin call, contradicting their earlier statement.","The prosecution is more convincing in this turn because the witness's response acknowledges the availability of other options to meet the margin call, which contradicts their earlier statement about being forced to sell Enron stock due to margin calls.",1,0,1,1,2,Questioner,1,0,0,0,-1,0.0,2.24,6.2,32.300000000000004,0.52059530643421,1.0338432617087945,-0.3301822058415157,-0.5132479552745844

""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

PROSECUTION: Remember the May, 2001, e-mail from Mr. Herrold advising you of a choice between accessing money from other lines of credit or selling back
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: – Enron stock?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So, that's choice number one, $11 million available?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And choice number two, selling assets that were summing in excess of $13 million of non-Enron stock. That was also available as an option as well, correct?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be so.

PROSECUTION: All right. So, sir, in sum, then, from July 26th through September 4th, when you sold $24 million of stock, you, in fact, had choices other than selling Enron stock during this period of time leading up to the online forum; isn't that right, sir?

Explanation:

* The witness's commitment level is detrimental (1) because their response acknowledges the existence of other options, which undermines their earlier statements and benefits the questioner.
* The witness's truthfulness is rated as 0 (not truthful) because their response is inconsistent with their earlier statements, and they seem to be avoiding a direct answer.
* The consistency value is 1 (inconsistent) because the witness's response contradicts their earlier statements about not having other options.
* The response relevance is 1 (very relevant) because it directly addresses the question and provides insight into the witness's actions.
* The response clarity is 2 (slightly clear with hedging) because the witness's response is brief and acknowledges the existence of other options, but does not provide a clear explanation or justification.
* The outcome value is ""Questioner"" because the witness's response reinforces the prosecution's argument and undermines the witness's credibility.
* The outcome reason is 1 (logical arguments are convincing) because the prosecution's questioning has presented a logical and convincing case, highlighting the witness's inconsistencies and questionable actions.","The prosecution has presented a strong case, highlighting the witness's inconsistent statements and questionable actions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?

* **Commitment level (2)**: The witness acknowledges that they could overturn any recommendation or decision made by their financial manager, which suggests a level of commitment to their role as the ultimate decision-maker. However, this commitment is beneficial to the witness, as it attempts to shift the focus away from their personal responsibility.
* **Truthfulness (1)**: The witness's response appears to be truthful, as they are acknowledging their role and authority in managing their finances.
* **Consistency (0)**: The witness's response is consistent with their previous testimony, as they have been attempting to downplay their personal responsibility and shift the focus to their financial managers.
* **Relevance (1)**: The witness's response is very relevant to the question, as it directly addresses their role and authority in managing their finances.
* **Clarity (2)**: The witness's response is slightly clear with hedging, as they use phrases like ""I could overturn any recommendation"" and ""if I was reachable"" to qualify their statements.
* **Outcome (Questioner)**: The questioner appears to be winning this turn, as they have successfully elicited a response from the witness that acknowledges their ultimate authority and raises questions about their commitment to the truth.
* **Outcome reason (1)**: The questioner's logical arguments and questioning strategy are convincing, as they have been able to poke holes in the witness's previous testimony and raise suspicions about their credibility.","The witness seems to be attempting to deflect responsibility while still acknowledging their ultimate authority, which may raise some suspicions about their commitment to the truth.",2,1,0,1,2,Questioner,1,0,0,0,-1,1.0,0.0,8.2,34.540000000000006,1.2070946116221786,1.1966481371661395,0.004345920320011346,0.010446474456039079

And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

PROSECUTION: Remember the May, 2001, e-mail from Mr. Herrold advising you of a choice between accessing money from other lines of credit or selling back
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: – Enron stock?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So, that's choice number one, $11 million available?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And choice number two, selling assets that were summing in excess of $13 million of non-Enron stock. That was also available as an option as well, correct?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be so.

PROSECUTION: All right. So, sir, in sum, then, from July 26th through September 4th, when you sold $24 million of stock, you, in fact, had choices other than selling Enron stock during this period of time leading up to the online forum; isn't that right, sir?
D_WITNESS: There were other options, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, Mr. Beau Herrold assisted you in managing your finances?
D_WITNESS: He did.

PROSECUTION: But you ultimately were in charge, correct? He took direction from you?
D_WITNESS: Well, certainly, I was-I could overturn any recommendation or decision that they were making. And-but they would try to run, certainly, the more important decisions by me if they could, I mean, if I was reachable. Quite often, if I was traveling, they had to go ahead and kind of do whatever they could do.

PROSECUTION: Right. Well, one of the more important things would be to work with you to avoid selling any more shares than you had to during this time period. That would be important to you, correct?

Explanation:

* The witness's commitment level is detrimental (1) because they are admitting to having other options available, which contradicts their earlier testimony.
* The witness's truthfulness is rated as 0 (not truthful) because their responses are inconsistent and defensive, suggesting that they may be hiding something.
* The consistency value is 1 (inconsistent) because the witness's current response contradicts their earlier testimony.
* The relevance rate is 1 (very relevant) because the witness's response directly addresses the question and provides important information.
* The manner rate is 2 (slightly clear with hedging) because the witness's response is somewhat clear, but they are also hedging and being defensive.
* The outcome value is ""Questioner"" because the prosecution is gaining the upper hand in the cross-examination.
* The outcome reason is 1 (logical arguments are convincing) because the prosecution's questions are logical and well-reasoned, and the witness's responses are becoming increasingly defensive and inconsistent.","The prosecution is gaining the upper hand in this cross-examination, as the witness's responses are becoming increasingly defensive and inconsistent.

Yes, it is.",enron_defense_2,"PROSECUTION: Mr. Petrocelli asked Mr. Skilling, ""Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight? His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?

D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

PROSECUTION: Remember the May, 2001, e-mail from Mr. Herrold advising you of a choice between accessing money from other lines of credit or selling back
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: – Enron stock?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So, that's choice number one, $11 million available?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And choice number two, selling assets that were summing in excess of $13 million of non-Enron stock. That was also available as an option as well, correct?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be so.

PROSECUTION: All right. So, sir, in sum, then, from July 26th through September 4th, when you sold $24 million of stock, you, in fact, had choices other than selling Enron stock during this period of time leading up to the online forum; isn't that right, sir?
D_WITNESS: There were other options, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, Mr. Beau Herrold assisted you in managing your finances?
D_WITNESS: He did.

PROSECUTION: But you ultimately were in charge, correct? He took direction from you?
D_WITNESS: Well, certainly, I was-I could overturn any recommendation or decision that they were making. And-but they would try to run, certainly, the more important decisions by me if they could, I mean, if I was reachable. Quite often, if I was traveling, they had to go ahead and kind of do whatever they could do.

PROSECUTION: Right. Well, one of the more important things would be to work with you to avoid selling any more shares than you had to during this time period. That would be important to you, correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it would . . .

PROSECUTION: It’s an e-mail from Mr. Herrold to you, dated May 21st, 2001.

COURT: All right. It's admitted.

PROSECUTION: I'll read it aloud. It's from Mr. Herrold to you, Mr. Lay, on May 21, 2001?
D_WITNESS: Yes. Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Okay. One choice was to use $5.9 million of available monies on your Bank of America line of credit, correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And the other was to use money from your Enron line of credit, right?

Explanation:

* The witness's commitment level is detrimental (1) because their response benefits the questioner by acknowledging the availability of other options to meet the margin call.
* The witness's truthfulness is rated as 0 because their previous testimony has been inconsistent, and they have been evasive in their responses.
* The consistency value is 1 because the witness's current response is inconsistent with their previous testimony.
* The relevance rate is 1 because the witness's response is directly relevant to the question being asked.
* The manner rate is 2 because the witness's response is slightly clear but hedged, as they are trying to downplay the significance of their actions.
* The outcome value is ""Questioner"" because the prosecution is gaining the upper hand in the cross-examination.
* The outcome reason is 1 because the prosecution's logical arguments are convincing, and they are effectively highlighting the inconsistencies in the witness's testimony.","The prosecution is gaining the upper hand in this cross-examination, as the witness's responses are becoming increasingly inconsistent and unclear.

His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
