His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate the current response in the cross-examination. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question posed by the prosecution was to Mr. Skilling: ""Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight?"" Skilling answered ""No."" Then, the question was posed to Mr. Lay: ""Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?"" Now, the witness's response is: ""And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?""

Alright, so the witness is being asked about whether they had a conversation with someone to get their story straight for trial. The witness is now responding by asking for more details and clarifying what story is being referred to.

Looking at the properties:

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness is asking for clarification, which suggests they might not be committed to the answer. They're seeking more information, so maybe a neutral commitment (3) because they're not directly answering yet.

2. **Truthfulness**: The witness is asking for more information, which doesn't necessarily mean they're lying. They might be trying to get clarity, so perhaps truthful (1).

3. **Consistency**: Since they're asking for more details, it's unclear if this is consistent with previous testimony. They might be contradicting themselves or providing more context, so maybe inconsistent (1) because they're not giving a direct answer.

4. **Relevance**: The question about the specific story is relevant because it relates to the original question about having a conversation to get the story straight. So relevance is high, maybe very relevant (1).

5. **Clarity**: The response is somewhat unclear because they're asking for more information rather than providing a direct answer. So clarity might be slightly unclear (3).

6. **Outcome**: The outcome here is the witness's turn because they're responding to the question, not the questioner.

7. **Reason**: The reason for the outcome could be an attempt to clarify the story, which might be seen as an attempt to attack the other side's credibility by forcing them to explain their story more, thus creating doubt (2).

Putting it all together, the witness has a neutral commitment, is truthful, inconsistent with previous testimony by not answering directly, the response is slightly unclear, and the outcome is the witness's turn with a credibility attack reason.

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness is talking about telling stories, which might imply he's not fully committed to the truth. He's saying he's here to answer questions, which could mean he's not trying to hide anything. So, maybe it's a neutral commitment because he's not directly benefiting the questioner but also not detrimental.

2. **Truthfulness**: The witness is saying he's telling stories, which could be a way to deflect or not provide the necessary information. If he's not being truthful about the conversation, that's a point against him.

3. **Consistency**: We don't have previous testimony, so we can't assess consistency. It's a neutral point here.

4. **Relevance**: The response is about his role in the testimony, which is relevant because it relates to the question about conversations. So, it's somewhat relevant.

5. **Clarity**: His response is a bit vague. He's using phrases like ""I'm not sure I"" and ""I'm telling stories up here."" It's not very clear, so clarity is low.

6. **Outcome**: The witness is answering the question, so the outcome is his turn.

7. **Reason**: The main issue here is whether he's truthful. Since he's deflecting, it's a credibility attack on the prosecution's side.

Looking at the properties one by one:

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness didn't answer the question directly. They didn't confirm or deny contacting witnesses. So, it's neutral because they didn't commit to either side. I think this is a 3.

2. **Truthfulness**: The witness is saying they don't know if they contacted witnesses. If they actually haven't, then it's truthful. But if they did contact them, it's a lie. Since the witness is unsure, it's a bit tricky, but I'll go with 0 for not truthful because they're not giving a clear answer.

3. **Consistency**: The witness hasn't given a consistent answer before. They might have said something else earlier, but without context, it's hard to say. So, maybe 1 for inconsistent.

4. **Relevance**: The response is directly answering the question about contacting witnesses, which is relevant. So, 1.

5. **Clarity**: The answer is a bit unclear because it's a negative statement without specifics. So, 3.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me go through each property one by one.

First, the witness commitment level. The witness is answering whether the chairman of the committee can decide what to do with the information. The witness says, ""I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information."" So, the witness is indicating that they believe the chairman can make such a decision. That seems like a neutral commitment because they're stating an opinion without necessarily benefiting the side or harming it. So, I think the commitment level is 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is saying that the chairman can make a decision. If the chairman actually can make decisions, then the statement is truthful. But if the chairman can't, then it's not truthful. However, without more context, I have to assume the witness is being truthful in their assertion. So, I'll rate this as 1.

For consistency, I need to compare this response to previous testimony. The transcript doesn't show previous testimony, so I can't assess consistency. Therefore, I'll mark this as 0.

Regarding relevance, the witness is explaining their belief about the chairman's ability to make decisions. This directly relates to the question about whether information was shared with the chairman, so it's very relevant. So, relevance is 1.

Response clarity: The witness's answer is clear, but it's a bit long and uses ""I would think"" which might imply uncertainty. However, it's still very clear overall. So, clarity is 1.

The outcome of this turn is with the witness because they're responding to the prosecution's question. So, outcome_value is ""Witness.""

For the outcome reason, the witness is providing a logical argument about the chairman's decision-making authority, which is a logical argument. So, reason 1 applies.

Putting it all together, the witness has a neutral commitment, is truthful, consistent (though I'm not sure since there's no prior testimony), very relevant, clear, and the outcome is in their favor with a logical argument.

D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one to understand how to assess the witness's performance.

First, the witness's commitment level. The question was whether the witness had contacted witnesses to get their story straight. The witness responded, ""I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston."" I'm not sure what the witness is referring to here. It seems like they're shifting the conversation to a different topic rather than directly answering whether they contacted witnesses. So, maybe their commitment is neutral because they're not directly addressing the question but rather bringing up a different issue.

Next, truthfulness. The witness says, ""I think we're now getting into form over substance."" If this is a truthful statement, it would mean they're honestly pointing out that the conversation is moving away from the main topic. However, if they're lying about not contacting witnesses, then this statement might not be truthful. But since the witness is bringing up a new topic, maybe the statement is truthful in context, but it's a bit vague.

Consistency with previous testimony. I don't have the previous testimony, but if the witness has been answering questions truthfully before, this statement might be inconsistent if they're now diverting the conversation. Alternatively, if they're just explaining the shift in the conversation, it could be consistent.

Response relevance. The witness's response is about form over substance, which is a general comment about the nature of the discussion. It's not directly answering the question about contacting witnesses, so it's somewhat relevant but not directly tied to the immediate question.

Response clarity. The response is a bit vague. The witness is saying they're getting into form over substance, but it's not clear what that means in this context. It's a bit unclear, so maybe the clarity rating is slightly unclear.

Current turn outcome. The witness is responding, so their role here is the witness. The outcome is the witness's turn because they're responding to the question.

Reason for the outcome. The witness is changing the subject, which could be seen as an attempt to avoid answering the specific question, thus diverting attention away from the original topic.

Putting it all together, the witness is not directly answering the question, which might indicate a neutral commitment. Their statement is vague and truthful in the context of shifting the conversation, but it's unclear. They're also changing the subject, which could be seen as an attempt to avoid answering the specific question. So, their commitment is neutral, they're somewhat truthful, inconsistent if they were previously answering directly, slightly relevant, unclear, and they're the witness in this turn.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as instructed.

First, the witness's commitment level. The question was whether the witness notified Mr. Duncan about the investment in Photophete. The witness answered, ""No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee."" Hmm, so the witness is saying ""No"" to notifying Duncan, but then explaining why they wouldn't. It seems like they're committed to following the rules, which might mean they don't want to break any rules, so their commitment is neutral because they're not directly committing to notifying or not notifying, but rather explaining their reasoning. So I think commitment level is 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness answered ""No"" directly to the question, but then provided an explanation. The initial ""No"" seems truthful, but the explanation is a bit vague with ""Jet him decide"" which is a typo, probably meant ""Just him decide."" So the truthful part is the ""No,"" but the explanation is unclear. So I'd rate truthfulness as 0 because the answer isn't fully truthful due to the unclear explanation.

Consistency with previous testimony. I don't have the previous testimony, but if the witness has been consistent in their answers, maybe they've said similar things before. But since I don't have that info, I'll assume they're inconsistent because their answer now is more of an explanation rather than a direct answer. So consistency is 1.

Response relevance. The witness answered the question directly with ""No"" but then went into a detailed explanation about the rules. The initial ""No"" is relevant, but the explanation is somewhat tangential. So relevance is 2.

Response clarity. The initial ""No"" is clear, but the explanation is unclear with typos and vague language. So clarity is 3.

Current turn outcome. The witness answered the question directly with ""No,"" so the outcome is Witness.

Outcome reason. The witness's answer is more of an explanation rather than a logical argument, so it's not a strong case. It's more about attacking credibility by showing they didn't follow through, so it's a credibility attack on the other side.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is somewhat truthful with a ""No,"" but their explanation is unclear and not very relevant. They're neutral in commitment, inconsistent if previous testimony was different, and their main point is not very clear. The outcome is against the witness, but it's a credibility issue.

First, the witness commitment level. The witness says, ""Rules are important, but they should not—you should not be a slave to rules, either..."" Hmm, the witness is expressing that while rules are important, they shouldn't be followed slavishly. That seems like a neutral stance because they're not necessarily committing to not following the rules but rather suggesting a balance. So I think this is a neutral commitment, which would be level 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is saying they shouldn't be a slave to the rules, which is a direct response to the prosecutor's question about whether they followed the rules. This seems truthful because they're addressing the question and providing their stance. So truthfulness is level 1.

Consistency with previous testimony. I don't have the previous testimony, but if the witness has been consistent in other parts, maybe this is consistent. However, without knowing prior statements, it's a bit hard to judge. But since the witness is answering the current question directly, I'll assume consistency unless there's evidence to the contrary. So maybe level 0, consistent.

Response relevance. The witness is talking about rules in general, which relates to the question about following the rules. So it's somewhat relevant but not the most direct answer. Maybe level 2.

Response clarity. The response is a bit vague. The witness is saying they shouldn't be a slave to rules but not providing specific details. There's some hedging, like ""should not—you should not be a slave,"" which makes it slightly unclear. So level 2.

Current turn outcome. The questioner is asking about commitment and truthfulness, and the witness is responding. So the outcome is the witness, level 0.

Outcome reason. The witness is providing a balanced opinion on rules, which could be seen as a credible response, so maybe it's not a logical argument but more about credibility. So level 2.

Putting it all together, the witness has a neutral commitment, is truthful, consistent, slightly relevant, slightly unclear, and the outcome is the witness's turn with a credibility-based reason.

","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this witness's response during cross-examination. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question posed by the prosecution was whether the witness followed the rules regarding notifying Mr. Duncan about the investment in Photophete. The witness's answer was, ""I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I mean, he well may have said it.""

Looking at the first property, witness commitment level. The witness is saying he doesn't remember the exact phrasing, but he's indicating uncertainty. So he's not actively trying to avoid answering, but he's also not confidently saying yes or no. That seems neutral, so I'd rate that as 3.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is saying he doesn't remember exactly, but he's not outright lying. He's just uncertain. So that's truthful, so 1.

Consistency: The witness's current answer is about the opening statement, not about his previous testimony. So unless there's a contradiction in his past, this is consistent. I'll say 1.

Relevance: The question is about whether he followed the rules, and his answer is about the phrasing of another statement. It's somewhat tangential, so maybe slightly irrelevant. I'll rate that as 2.

Clarity: The response is a bit vague. He's using phrases like ""I don't,"" ""find the phrasing kind of interesting,"" and ""he well may have said it."" That's a bit unclear, so I'll give it a 3.

Outcome: The questioner is asking if he followed the rules, and the witness is responding. So the outcome is the witness's turn, so 2.

The reason for the outcome: The witness is providing a truthful answer, but it's a bit unclear. So maybe it's a mix of truthful but unclear, but since it's a yes/no question, the main issue is whether he's committed and whether he's truthful. Since he's neutral on commitment, truthful, consistent, and somewhat relevant but unclear, the main issue is whether he's being helpful. But since he's answering, it's a witness turn.

Wait, but the witness is answering a yes/no question about whether he followed the rules. His answer is about the phrasing of another statement, which is somewhat tangential. So maybe the relevance is low, but he's still answering, so it's a witness turn. The main issue is whether he's being truthful and clear.

I think the key points are that he's not committed to avoiding the question, he's truthful, consistent, and his answer is somewhat unclear but still relevant enough to be considered. So the witness's turn is ongoing, but his answer is not very clear.

D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one to figure out how to assess the witness's testimony.

First, the witness commitment level. The question was about whether selling property in Aspen was a long, tedious process. The witness answered, ""Yes, it was."" Hmm, that seems like a direct answer to the question. So, the witness is committed to answering the question because they're providing information that's relevant to the case. I don't see any signs of hesitation or avoiding the question, so I think this is a 2: Beneficial commitment.

Next, truthfulness. The witness answered ""Yes, it was."" If the question was whether it was a long, tedious process, a ""Yes"" seems truthful unless there's evidence of fabrication. Since the witness is testifying, and they're answering straightforwardly, I'd say this is truthful, so a 1.

For consistency, the witness has given this answer before, right? Earlier in the testimony, the witness mentioned Aspen property. So, this answer aligns with previous statements, making it consistent. So, 0 for inconsistent.

Response relevance: The question was about the Aspen property, and the answer directly addresses that. It's very relevant because it's about the process of selling the property, which is a key point in the case. So, 1 for very relevant.

Response clarity: The answer is clear. ""Yes, it was"" is straightforward and easy to understand. There's no ambiguity or hedging involved, so it's very clear, which is 1.

The outcome of the current turn is between the questioner and the witness. The witness answered, so the outcome is 2: Witness.

Now, the reason for the outcome. The witness provided a clear, direct answer to the question, which supports their credibility. There's no logical argument here; it's more about the witness's reliability. So, it's not about attacking the other side's credibility or using emotional bias. It's just a straightforward answer, so maybe it's not falling into any of the other categories. Wait, but the options are logical arguments, credibility attack, or emotional appeal. Since the witness is answering truthfully and clearly, it's more about the witness's reliability, which isn't covered in the options. Hmm, maybe it's not covered, but since the options don't include that, perhaps it's not applicable. But looking back, the options are 1, 2, or 3. Since the witness is providing a truthful and clear answer, it's more about their credibility, so maybe it's a credibility attack. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's just a straightforward answer, so maybe it's not a credibility attack. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe it's not applicable, but since the options are limited, I'll go with 2: Credibility attack on the other side, even though it's not exactly clear. Alternatively, maybe it's not a credibility attack but just a truthful answer, so perhaps it's not covered. But since the options don't include 'just truthful answer,' I'll have to choose the closest one, which might be 2.

Putting it all together, the witness has a beneficial commitment, the answer is truthful, consistent, very relevant and clear, and the outcome is the witness answering. The reason is likely about credibility, even though it's a bit of a stretch.

D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this cross-examination between the prosecution and a witness. The witness is responding to a series of questions about his actions regarding the Aspen property and his stock dealings with Enron. Let me break down each property and see how the witness is handling it.

First, the witness is asked about the Aspen property. The prosecution is asking if he listed it after selling his Enron stock. The witness responds, ""Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly."" 

Looking at the properties one by one:

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness says ""Yes, we did."" This seems like a direct answer to the question about listing the property after selling stock. It shows he knows when it was listed and that he did list it. So, this is a beneficial commitment because he's confirming an action he took, which is relevant to the case.

2. **Truthfulness**: The response is straightforward and doesn't contain any contradictions. He's confirming the transaction happened, so it's truthful.

3. **Consistency**: The witness has given similar responses before, so this is consistent with his previous testimony.

4. **Relevance**: The answer directly addresses the question about listing the property after selling stock, so it's very relevant.

5. **Clarity**: The response is clear, but there's some hedging (""apparently"" and ""and""). So, it's slightly clear with a bit of hedging.

6. **Outcome**: The questioner is asking the witness, so the outcome is the witness.

7. **Reason for Outcome**: The witness is providing a straightforward answer, which is logical and consistent, so the reason is logical arguments.

Putting it all together, the witness is showing a beneficial commitment, being truthful, consistent, highly relevant, slightly clear, and the outcome is the witness because he provided a clear and logical answer.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one to figure out how to assess them.

First, the witness commitment level. The question was about the Aspen property, and the witness answered ""Yes"" to whether he got $10 million in two days. I think a ""Yes"" is a clear affirmative, so that shows he's committed to the answer. So that's probably a 2, which is a beneficial commitment because he's confirming the details.

Next, truthfulness. The witness answered ""Yes"" directly to the question. If he's answering honestly, that's truthful. I don't see any lies or evasions here, so that's a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony. I don't have the full transcript, but from what I remember, the witness has given consistent answers before. So this ""Yes"" aligns with his previous statements, making it consistent. That's a 0.

Response relevance. The question was about the Aspen property sale, and the answer directly relates to that. It's very relevant because it's about the same topic they've been discussing. So that's a 1.

Response clarity. The answer is straightforward: ""Yes."" There's no hedging or uncertainty, so it's very clear. That's a 1.

Current turn outcome. The questioner is asking about the Aspen property, and the witness is answering. So the outcome is the witness's turn, which is 2.

For the reasons, the witness's answer is logical because it's a direct affirmation of the sale. There's no emotional appeal or credibility attack; it's just a clear answer. So the reason is 1, logical arguments are convincing.

Putting it all together, the witness is committed, truthful, consistent, and his answer is very relevant and clear. So he's performing well in this turn.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as instructed.

First, the commitment level. The witness was asked if they got $10 million from selling the Aspen property. They responded, ""It was."" Hmm, that's a bit vague. I'm not sure if that means yes or no. It doesn't really commit to the answer, so maybe it's neutral. But since they did get the money, maybe it's a slight commitment. I'll go with 3: Neutral commitment.

Next, truthfulness. The witness said, ""It was."" That seems straightforward. They're answering the question directly, so it's truthful. I'll rate that a 1.

Consistency. Looking back at previous testimony, I don't have the exact details, but if the witness has given consistent answers before, this might be consistent. However, since the current response is just a yes or no without more context, it's hard to say. I'll assume consistency, so 0.

Relevance. The question was about the sale of the Aspen property, and the response directly addresses that. It's very relevant, so 1.

Clarity. The response is very clear. They answered directly without any hedging or uncertainty. So, 1.

Outcome. The questioner is asking the witness a direct question about a specific fact, so the witness is responding. Therefore, the outcome is the witness.

Reason for the outcome. Since the witness answered directly and truthfully, it's not about attacking credibility or using emotional appeal. It's just a straightforward answer, so maybe it's 1: Logical arguments are convincing, but in this case, it's more about the witness's straightforwardness.

Wait, but the witness's answer is ""It was,"" which is a bit vague. Maybe it's not as clear as I thought. Let me reconsider. If the witness is just confirming that the sale happened, maybe it's slightly unclear because they didn't specify how much they got. But in the context of the question, they were asked if they got $10 million, so ""It was"" might imply yes, which is truthful. So, maybe clarity is still 1.

Putting it all together, the witness has a neutral commitment, is truthful, consistent, very relevant, very clear, and the outcome is the witness. The reason is that the answer is straightforward and truthful.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as instructed.

First, the commitment level. The witness answered ""Yes"" to the question about the Aspen property. The question was whether the witness got any benefit from the Aspen property sale after selling Enron stock. The witness's answer is ""Yes,"" which suggests a direct benefit. So, this is a beneficial commitment because the witness is indicating that they personally benefited from the sale. So, I think the commitment level is 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness answered ""Yes"" to the question about the Aspen property. I need to check if this answer is truthful. The prosecution asked about the sale of the Aspen property, specifically whether the witness got any benefit from it. The witness's answer is ""Yes,"" which seems consistent with the information provided earlier. They listed the property after selling Enron stock, and it was sold quickly for the full asking price. So, the answer is truthful. Therefore, the truthfulness score is 1.

Consistency with previous testimony. The witness has given similar answers before, like when asked about the $10 million sale. They mentioned listing it after selling Enron stock and getting the full price. So, this answer aligns with their previous statements. Therefore, the consistency score is 0, meaning consistent.

Response relevance. The question was about whether the witness got any benefit from selling the Aspen property after selling Enron stock. The answer ""Yes"" directly addresses this, so it's very relevant. The relevance score is 1.

Response clarity. The answer is straightforward and clear. They didn't hedge or use any uncertainty phrases. So, clarity is very high, score 1.

Current turn outcome. The questioner is asking the witness a question, so the outcome is the questioner. The witness is responding, so it's their turn to answer.

Outcome reason. The witness's answer is direct and truthful, so it's based on logical arguments. They provided a clear yes, which supports their position. So, the reason is 1, logical arguments are convincing.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is beneficial, truthful, consistent, highly relevant, clear, and logically convincing. Therefore, the witness is more credible in this instance.

Outcome reason. The witness's answer is direct and truthful, so it's based on logical arguments. They provided a clear yes, which supports their position. So, the reason is 1, logical arguments are convincing.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is beneficial, truthful, consistent, highly relevant, clear, and logically convincing. Therefore, the witness is more credible in this instance.","The witness's response is truthful, consistent, and logically convincing, indicating a beneficial commitment to the Aspen property sale.",2,1,0,1,1,Questioner,1,0,0,0,0.4705882352941176,1.0,0.0,10.5,5.7,-0.109461244069802,-0.6699969163334701,-0.7191350360276696,0.5605356722636682

D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as instructed.

First, the witness commitment level. The question was about whether the witness had a personal financial interest in Enron's stock performance. The witness answered yes, which suggests they felt it was important because they had invested in Enron. That's a positive commitment, so I'd rate this as 2: Beneficial commitment.

Next, truthfulness. The witness answered ""Yes"" to the question about their personal belief regarding Enron stock. I need to check if this answer aligns with their previous testimony. In earlier parts of the transcript, the witness talked about their stock purchases and separating discretionary from forced decisions. This answer seems consistent with that, so it's truthful. I'll give this a 1.

For consistency, I compare the current answer with previous statements. The witness had mentioned buying 4 million shares and separating optional decisions from forced ones. The current answer about their belief aligns with that, so it's consistent. I'll rate this as 1.

Regarding relevance, the answer directly addresses the question about their personal belief and investment, which is highly relevant. So, I'll give it a 1.

Clarity-wise, the answer is straightforward. They simply stated ""Yes,"" without any hedging or ambiguity. So, clarity is very high, rated 1.

The outcome is that the witness responded to the question, so it's their turn. I'll note that as 1.

As for the reason, the witness provided a logical argument about their personal investment and decisions, which supports their position. This is a credible and logical response, so the reason is 1.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is beneficial, truthful, consistent, and highly relevant and clear. They effectively addressed the question with a logical argument, making their position credible.

First, the witness commitment level. The question was about whether the witness had a conversation about getting their story straight. The witness answered, ""That appears to be, yes."" Hmm, that seems like a direct answer to the question. So, they're confirming that they did have such a conversation. That sounds like a strong commitment because they're directly answering the question. So, I think this is a 4 for commitment level because they made a clear commitment to the question.

Next, truthfulness. The witness answered affirmatively, saying yes. If they were lying, they might have said no, but since they're confirming, it seems truthful. So, I'll rate this as 1 for truthfulness.

For consistency, I need to check if this answer aligns with what the witness said before. Looking back, the witness had previously discussed their story and the rules, and in the Aspen property section, they mentioned not having told employees about sales. They also talked about being careful with Enron stock. So, in this part, they're confirming that they did have a conversation, which is consistent with their earlier testimony. So, this is consistent, which is a 0.

Relevance: The question was whether they had a conversation about getting their story straight. The answer directly addresses that, so it's very relevant. I'll give this a 1.

Clarity: The answer is straightforward. They just said yes, without any hedging or unclear language. So, clarity is very high, which is a 1.

Outcome: The questioner is asking the witness whether they had a conversation. The witness answered yes, so the witness is the one who responded. So, the outcome is the witness.

Reason for the outcome: The witness is providing a direct answer to the question, which is logical and straightforward. There's no emotional appeal or credibility attack here; it's just a clear response. So, the reason is logical arguments are convincing.

","Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to evaluate this witness's response during cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as instructed.

First, the witness's commitment level. The question was about whether the witness went back to Enron on the line of credit. The witness's response was, ""If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount."" So, the witness is saying that if they did go back, they would typically sell the full amount. That seems like a commitment because they're indicating their intention or willingness to act in a certain way. So, I think this is a 2: Beneficial commitment because it's about how much they would sell, which could affect the case.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is saying they would go for the full amount if they did go back. But earlier testimony suggests that they only sold $4 million, which was a partial amount. So, if the witness is now saying they would go for the full amount, that's inconsistent with their previous statements. Therefore, this is not truthful, so it's a 0.

For consistency, we've already determined that the witness is contradicting themselves because they previously admitted to selling only part of their stock. So, this is inconsistent with previous testimony, which would be a 1.

Relevance: The response is directly answering the question about whether they would go back and how much, which is highly relevant to the case. So, it's a 1.

Clarity: The response is clear. They're stating a straightforward intention, so it's a 1.

Outcome: The questioner is asking the witness about their actions, so the witness is responding, making the outcome a 2: Witness.

Reason for the outcome: The witness is providing a response that contradicts their previous statements, which could be seen as an attempt to attack the credibility of the opposing side. So, it's a 2: Credibility attack on the opposing side.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is not truthful, inconsistent with previous testimony, highly relevant, clear, and the outcome is the witness's turn because they're providing a response that's contradictory.

His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response during cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as per the instructions.

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness says, ""I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was."" The witness is talking about selling stock to get more money, which seems like a benefit to them personally. So, this is a beneficial commitment. That would be level 2.

2. **Truthfulness**: The witness is answering the question about the margin call. They're explaining their usual behavior, which is to sell stock to get more liquidity. This seems truthful because they're providing a consistent answer without any contradictions.

3. **Consistency**: Looking back at previous testimony, the witness mentioned that he usually sells stock when there's a margin call. This response aligns with that, so it's consistent. That's level 0.

4. **Relevance**: The question was about why the witness didn't tell employees about the sales. The response doesn't directly address that. Instead, it's explaining his own behavior regarding margin calls. So, it's somewhat relevant but not directly answering the question. Maybe level 2.

5. **Clarity**: The response is clear, but it's a bit long. They mention selling stock to get liquidity, which is straightforward. So, clarity level 1.

6. **Outcome**: The question was about whether the witness had a conversation with someone about getting the story straight. The witness is answering, so the outcome is the witness's turn. Level 1.

7. **Reason for Outcome**: The witness is providing an explanation about their usual behavior, which is a logical argument. They're not attacking the other side's credibility or using emotional appeals. So, the reason is logical arguments are convincing.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is truthful, consistent, and somewhat relevant. The explanation is clear, and it logically addresses the question without any bias or emotional appeal.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as per the instructions.

First, the witness commitment level. The question was about whether the witness had a margin call and sold $4 million of Enron stock. The witness's response was ""Apparently not."" I think that's a bit vague. It doesn't clearly answer yes or no. So maybe it's a neutral commitment because they didn't directly confirm or deny it.

Next, truthfulness. The witness said ""Apparently not,"" which seems to contradict their previous testimony where they admitted to selling $4 million. So this might be untruthful, but I'm not sure if it's completely false or just unclear.

Consistency: In previous testimony, the witness admitted to selling $4 million. Now saying ""Apparently not"" is conflicting. That's inconsistent because they're denying something they previously stated.

Response relevance: The question was about the margin call and the sale. The witness's response doesn't directly address that, so it's slightly irrelevant.

Response clarity: The answer is a bit unclear because it's not a straightforward yes or no. It's more of a hedge, which makes it a bit unclear.

Outcome-wise, the witness's response is the questioner's turn because they're answering the charge. The reason for the outcome is that the witness is contradicting themselves, which could be seen as an inconsistency, so maybe it's an emotional appeal or credibility attack.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is inconsistent with previous testimony, untruthful, and not very clear. It's slightly relevant but not directly addressing the question. The main issue is the contradiction, which could be used to attack the witness's credibility.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is neutral, not very truthful, inconsistent with previous statements, slightly relevant, unclear, and the outcome is that the witness didn't answer the question, which could be seen as a credibility issue.",,3,0,1,2,4,Witness,2,0,1,0,0.4782608695652174,0.5,3.1000000000000005,14.5,17.1,0.4637176339684336,0.5575331482346375,-0.0918633463015052,-0.0938155142662038

His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the current response from the witness in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as per the instructions.

First, the witness commitment level. The question was about the availability of borrowing options on July 26th. The witness's response was, ""Well, apparently."" That doesn't really commit to anything specific. It's more of a statement than an admission or denial. So, I think this is a neutral commitment because they didn't affirm or deny anything significant.

Next, truthfulness. The witness said, ""Well, apparently."" This seems like a vague response, but it doesn't necessarily lie. It's more of a filler or an attempt to avoid giving a clear answer. So, I'd rate this as truthful, but maybe not entirely because it's not very specific.

Consistency with previous testimony. I need to recall previous statements. Earlier, the witness talked about selling $4 million of stock due to a margin call and had over $11 million in borrowing options. The current response doesn't contradict that; it's just a continuation of the same topic. So, it's consistent.

Response relevance. The question was about the availability of borrowing options, which is directly related to the witness's testimony. The response doesn't add new information but continues the discussion, so it's relevant but not super significant.

Response clarity. The answer is ""Well, apparently."" It's not very clear. There's a lot of uncertainty here, so it's unclear.

Current turn outcome. The questioner is asking about the borrowing options, and the witness responds. So, the outcome is the witness's turn.

Reason for the outcome. The witness's response is unclear, which might make their answer less reliable. So, the reason could be that the response is unclear, affecting credibility.

Putting it all together, the witness has a neutral commitment, their response is somewhat truthful but vague, consistent with previous statements, relevant but not super important, unclear, and it's the witness's turn. The main issue is the clarity and specificity of their answer.

First, the witness's commitment level. The question was about the choices on July 26th regarding the margin call. The witness answered, ""Yes."" I'm not sure if that's a strong commitment.

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is directly answering a yes/no question about an event they had to consider. They're confirming that they did make the choice, so that's a beneficial commitment. So, commitment level 2.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is stating ""Yes,"" which seems consistent with their previous testimony. They've talked about selling stock during margin calls before, so this is truthful. So, truthfulness score 1.

Consistency: The witness has given similar answers before, so this is consistent with their past statements. So, consistency 0.

Relevance: The question is directly related to the testimony, so the response is very relevant. Relevance 1.

Clarity: The answer is straightforward without any hedging or uncertainty. Clarity 1.

Outcome: The witness answered the question, so the outcome is Witness. The reason is logical arguments, as they're confirming a fact they've previously stated.

So, putting it all together, the witness has a beneficial commitment, is truthful, consistent, highly relevant, very clear, and the outcome is logical.

His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

PROSECUTION: Remember the May, 2001, e-mail from Mr. Herrold advising you of a choice between accessing money from other lines of credit or selling back
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: – Enron stock?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So, that's choice number one, $11 million available?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as per the instructions.

First, the commitment level. The witness is answering a question about whether they had a conversation with someone about getting their story straight. They answered ""Yes."" That seems like a direct commitment to having had such a conversation, so I think that's a 2, which is a neutral commitment.

Next, truthfulness. The witness is saying ""Yes"" to having had a conversation. If they actually had that conversation, then it's truthful. But I'm not sure if I have enough context to confirm that. The previous testimony mentioned that the witness didn't contact witnesses to get their story straight, so maybe they didn't have that conversation. If that's the case, then their answer might be 0, not truthful.

For consistency, I need to check if this answer aligns with previous testimony. Earlier, the witness said they didn't contact witnesses, so if they now say they did, that's inconsistent. So the consistency value would be 1, inconsistent.

Regarding relevance, the question is directly about whether they had a conversation, which is very relevant. So that's a 1, very relevant.

Clarity-wise, the response is straightforward. They answered ""Yes,"" so it's very clear, which is a 1.

The outcome is that the witness is answering, so the outcome value is 1 for witness.

The reason for the outcome could be logical arguments if they're trying to show they did something, but since it's a straightforward answer, maybe it's just a direct response. So perhaps it's not a strong emotional appeal or credibility attack, so maybe reason 1, logical arguments.

Putting it all together, the witness has a neutral commitment, their answer is not truthful if they didn't have the conversation, it's inconsistent with previous testimony, the response is very relevant and clear, and the outcome is a direct answer.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response during cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as per the instructions.

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness responded to the question about the margin call and stock sale. They said, ""That appears to be so."" This seems like a straightforward answer, not necessarily a strong commitment. They didn't elaborate on why they chose to sell the stock or whether they had any specific reasons. So, it's neutral. I think commitment level is 3.

2. **Truthfulness**: The witness's answer is ""That appears to be so."" This is a bit vague. They didn't provide any specific details or reasoning, just a general agreement. While it's not outright false, it's not very truthful because they didn't address the specifics of the question. So, truthfulness is 0.

3. **Consistency**: The witness has given similar answers in previous parts of the testimony. They've talked about selling stock during margin calls before, so this answer aligns with their previous statements. Therefore, it's consistent, so consistency is 0.

4. **Relevance**: The response directly answers the question about the margin call and stock sale, which is relevant to the discussion. It's slightly more detailed than just a yes or no, so relevance is 2.

5. **Clarity**: The response is clear but a bit vague. They didn't provide any specific figures or reasoning, just a general agreement. So, clarity is 3.

6. **Outcome**: The witness is responding to the question, so the outcome is their turn.

7. **Reason for Outcome**: The witness's answer is vague and doesn't provide substantial evidence or reasoning, which might be seen as a credibility issue. So, it's a credibility attack on the other side, which is reason 2.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is neutral in commitment, not very truthful, consistent with previous statements, slightly relevant, somewhat clear, and their turn because they didn't provide detailed answers.

And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

PROSECUTION: Remember the May, 2001, e-mail from Mr. Herrold advising you of a choice between accessing money from other lines of credit or selling back
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: – Enron stock?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So, that's choice number one, $11 million available?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And choice number two, selling assets that were summing in excess of $13 million of non-Enron stock. That was also available as an option as well, correct?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be so.

PROSECUTION: All right. So, sir, in sum, then, from July 26th through September 4th, when you sold $24 million of stock, you, in fact, had choices other than selling Enron stock during this period of time leading up to the online forum; isn't that right, sir?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response during the cross-examination. The question was whether the witness had a conversation with someone about getting their story straight for trial. The witness responded, ""There were other options, Mr. Hueston.""

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness is saying there were other options, which suggests they are acknowledging that they had choices beyond what was discussed. That seems like a neutral commitment because they're not directly answering whether they had a conversation or not, just adding that there were alternatives.

Next, truthfulness. The response is a direct answer to the question, so it's truthful. They didn't omit any important details but rather provided additional information.

Regarding consistency, this is a follow-up question, so the witness's previous testimony should be considered. If they've previously stated that they had other options, this is consistent. But since this is a new question, it's a bit tricky. However, the witness is providing relevant information, so it's consistent with their previous statements.

Relevance-wise, the response is directly answering the question about other options, so it's very relevant. It doesn't add unnecessary information but clarifies the situation.

Clarity is another point. The response is clear and straightforward, without much hedging or ambiguity. The witness is directly stating that there were other options.

In terms of the outcome, the witness is responding to the question, so the outcome is the witness. The reason for this is that the response is relevant and truthful, providing a clear answer to the question asked.

So, putting it all together, the witness has a neutral commitment, is truthful, consistent, highly relevant, clear, and the outcome is the witness because they provided a relevant and truthful answer.

Now, Mr. Beau Herrold assisted you in managing your finances?",He did.,enron_defense_2,"PROSECUTION: Mr. Petrocelli asked Mr. Skilling, ""Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight? His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, Mr. Beau Herrold assisted you in managing your finances?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response during the cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as per the instructions.

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness said he ""did"" help Mr. Herrold manage finances. That sounds like a clear commitment because he's affirming that he took action. So, it's not neutral or no commitment. It's more than just a yes or no; he's indicating he did something. So, I'd rate this as 4 (No commitment made) because he actually did something, which is a strong commitment.

2. **Truthfulness**: The response is ""He did."" That's straightforward and consistent with the previous testimony where he mentioned Herrold's assistance. So, it's truthful. I'll rate this as 1.

3. **Consistency**: The witness has given similar answers before, so this is consistent with his previous statements. So, consistency is 0.

4. **Relevance**: The question was about whether Mr. Herrold assisted in managing finances, which is directly relevant to the testimony. So, relevance is 1.

5. **Clarity**: The response is clear. He didn't use any hedging or unclear language. So, clarity is 1.

6. **Outcome**: The witness is responding, so the outcome is Witness.

7. **Reason for Outcome**: The witness is providing a straightforward answer, which is logical and consistent with previous statements. So, the reason is 1 (Logical arguments are convincing).

Putting it all together, the witness has a strong commitment, is truthful, consistent, the response is relevant and clear, and the outcome is logical.

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness says, ""Well, certainly, I was-I could overturn any recommendation or decision that they were making."" This suggests that the witness had control over the decisions, which indicates a beneficial commitment. So, I think this is a 2.

2. **Truthfulness**: The response is, ""I was able to overturn any recommendation or decision that they were making."" This sounds like the witness is explaining their ability to override others, which doesn't necessarily mean they're lying. It's more about their role. So, I'd rate this as 1, truthful.

3. **Consistency**: The witness mentions that they would try to run the more important decisions by them if they were reachable. This seems consistent with their previous testimony where they had control over their decisions. So, consistency is 0.

4. **Relevance**: The response talks about their ability to overturn decisions, which is relevant to the question of whether they followed the rules or not. So, relevance is 2.

5. **Clarity**: The response is a bit vague. They mention being able to overturn decisions but don't specify how often or under what circumstances. This makes it slightly unclear, so I'll give it a 3.

6. **Outcome**: The witness is answering the question posed by the prosecution, so the outcome is Witness.

7. **Reason for Outcome**: The witness is explaining their ability to make decisions, which could be seen as a credibility issue for the prosecution. So, it's a credibility attack, which is reason 2.

Putting it all together, the witness seems to be committed beneficially, their statement is somewhat truthful, consistent with previous testimony, relevant but not super clear, and the outcome is a credibility issue.

Putting it all together, the witness seems to be committed beneficially, their statement is somewhat truthful, consistent with previous testimony, relevant but not super clear, and the outcome is a credibility issue.",,2,1,0,2,3,Witness,Credibility attack on other side,0,1,0,0.6129032258064516,1.0,0.4,19.5,25.6,1.1801912315162282,1.4727967928687524,-0.1102928315782188,-0.2926055613525242

His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

PROSECUTION: Remember the May, 2001, e-mail from Mr. Herrold advising you of a choice between accessing money from other lines of credit or selling back
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: – Enron stock?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So, that's choice number one, $11 million available?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And choice number two, selling assets that were summing in excess of $13 million of non-Enron stock. That was also available as an option as well, correct?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be so.

PROSECUTION: All right. So, sir, in sum, then, from July 26th through September 4th, when you sold $24 million of stock, you, in fact, had choices other than selling Enron stock during this period of time leading up to the online forum; isn't that right, sir?
D_WITNESS: There were other options, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, Mr. Beau Herrold assisted you in managing your finances?
D_WITNESS: He did.

PROSECUTION: But you ultimately were in charge, correct? He took direction from you?
D_WITNESS: Well, certainly, I was-I could overturn any recommendation or decision that they were making. And-but they would try to run, certainly, the more important decisions by me if they could, I mean, if I was reachable. Quite often, if I was traveling, they had to go ahead and kind of do whatever they could do.

PROSECUTION: Right. Well, one of the more important things would be to work with you to avoid selling any more shares than you had to during this time period. That would be important to you, correct?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response in this cross-examination. Let me go through each of the properties one by one as per the instructions.

1. **Commitment Level**: The witness answered ""Yes, it would."" to the question about whether selling Enron stock was important to avoid selling more shares. Selling stock is a direct benefit, so this shows a strong commitment. I think this is a 4 because it's a clear yes without any hedging.

2. **Truthfulness**: The witness said ""Yes, it would."" which aligns with what the prosecution is asking. They're trying to get the witness to commit to not selling more shares than necessary. The answer is consistent with the question, so it's truthful. That's a 1.

3. **Consistency**: Looking back at previous testimony, the witness has generally been consistent. They've denied any wrongdoing and supported their statements with details. This ""Yes"" continues that pattern, so it's consistent. That's a 0.

4. **Relevance**: The question is directly about the witness's commitment to not over-sell, which is highly relevant to the ongoing testimony about their financial decisions. So this is very relevant, a 1.

5. **Clarity**: The response is straightforward. ""Yes, it would."" There's no ambiguity or hedging, so it's very clear. That's a 1.

6. **Outcome**: The witness is answering the question, so the outcome is the witness. That's a 0.

7. **Reason for Outcome**: The witness is providing a direct answer to the question, which is about their commitment to financial prudence. It's a logical argument because it's a clear yes based on their previous statements about managing stock sales.

Putting it all together, the witness has a strong commitment, is truthful, consistent, the response is very relevant and clear, and the outcome is logical.

","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response during cross-examination. The question was about an email from Mr. Herrold to the witness on May 21, 2001. The witness responded with ""Yes."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness answered ""Yes"" to whether they received the email. Since they confirmed receipt, it shows they were committed to discussing it, so that's a 2 (beneficial commitment).

Next, truthfulness. The witness confirmed the email was from Herrold and the date, so it's truthful, which is a 1.

Consistency is next. The witness's previous testimony about the email was consistent, so this is a 0 (consistent).

Relevance-wise, the response directly answers the question about the email, so it's very relevant, a 1.

Clarity is good because the response is straightforward without much hedging, so it's a 1.

The outcome is the witness's turn because they answered the question. The reason is logical arguments, as they provided clear information without any bias or emotional appeal.

D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

PROSECUTION: Remember the May, 2001, e-mail from Mr. Herrold advising you of a choice between accessing money from other lines of credit or selling back
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: – Enron stock?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So, that's choice number one, $11 million available?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And choice number two, selling assets that were summing in excess of $13 million of non-Enron stock. That was also available as an option as well, correct?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be so.

PROSECUTION: All right. So, sir, in sum, then, from July 26th through September 4th, when you sold $24 million of stock, you, in fact, had choices other than selling Enron stock during this period of time leading up to the online forum; isn't that right, sir?
D_WITNESS: There were other options, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, Mr. Beau Herrold assisted you in managing your finances?
D_WITNESS: He did.

PROSECUTION: But you ultimately were in charge, correct? He took direction from you?
D_WITNESS: Well, certainly, I was-I could overturn any recommendation or decision that they were making. And-but they would try to run, certainly, the more important decisions by me if they could, I mean, if I was reachable. Quite often, if I was traveling, they had to go ahead and kind of do whatever they could do.

PROSECUTION: Right. Well, one of the more important things would be to work with you to avoid selling any more shares than you had to during this time period. That would be important to you, correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it would . . .

PROSECUTION: It’s an e-mail from Mr. Herrold to you, dated May 21st, 2001.

COURT: All right. It's admitted.
nan: nan

PROSECUTION: I'll read it aloud. It's from Mr. Herrold to you, Mr. Lay, on May 21, 2001?
D_WITNESS: Yes. Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Okay. One choice was to use $5.9 million of available monies on your Bank of America line of credit, correct?
","Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate the witness's response during cross-examination. The question was about an email from Mr. Herrold to the witness on May 21, 2001. The prosecution read the email aloud, and the witness responded with ""Yes."" 

First, I need to assess the commitment level. The witness answered ""Yes"" to a question about the email, which shows they are confirming the existence of the email. That's a straightforward confirmation, so I think the commitment level is 2, which is beneficial because the witness is acknowledging the information presented.

Next, truthfulness. The witness answered ""Yes"" without any hesitation or lies. This indicates they are truthful in their response, so the truthfulness score is 1.

Consistency is next. The witness has given consistent answers throughout the testimony, so this ""Yes"" aligns with previous statements, making the consistency score 0.

Relevance-wise, the response directly answers the question about the email, which is highly relevant. So the relevance score is 1.

Clarity is another point. The response is very clear and direct, without any ambiguity or hedging. So clarity is 1.

The outcome of the current turn is between the witness and the questioner. Since the witness answered, the outcome is ""Witness.""

The reason for the outcome is logical arguments, as the witness is confirming the information, which is a logical step in the questioning process.

Putting it all together, the witness's response is truthful, consistent, relevant, and clear, which makes them credible and effective in their testimony.

78,78,Q/A,"And the other was to use money from your Enron line of credit, right?",Yes.,enron_defense_2,"PROSECUTION: Mr. Petrocelli asked Mr. Skilling, ""Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight? His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

Clarity. The response is straightforward: ""Yes."" There's no hedging or uncertainty, so that's very clear, a 1.

Outcome value. The questioner is asking the witness a direct question, so the witness is responding, making it a witness turn, which is a 0.

Outcome reason. The witness is giving a direct and truthful answer, so it's based on logical arguments, which is reason 1.

Next, truthfulness. The witness said ""Yes"" to the question. If they're answering honestly, that's truthful. So I'll rate that a 1.

Consistency with previous testimony. The witness has been testifying about various Enron-related matters, and this seems to align with what they've said before. So that's consistent, which is a 0.

Response relevance. The question is about whether they had a conversation about their story, which is directly relevant to the testimony. So that's very relevant, a 1.

Clarity. The response is straightforward: ""Yes."" There's no hedging or uncertainty, so that's very clear, a 1.

Outcome value. The questioner is asking the witness a direct question, so the witness is responding, making it a witness turn, which is a 0.

Outcome reason. The witness is giving a direct and truthful answer, so it's based on logical arguments, which is reason 1.

Putting it all together, the witness is committed neutrally, truthful, consistent, highly relevant, very clear, and the outcome is a witness turn with a logical reason.",,2,1,0,1,1,Witness,1,0,0,0,0.6111111111111112,1.0,0.0,23.5,26.1,1.7533701095544638,1.5266358307884065,0.069126179308796,0.2267342787660573
