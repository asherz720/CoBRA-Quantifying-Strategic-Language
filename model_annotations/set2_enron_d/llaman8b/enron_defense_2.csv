Explanation:

- Commitment level: The witness is trying to deflect the question by asking if he told Mr. Duncan about the Photofete situation, which is a change of subject. This is a neutral commitment, as it doesn't directly answer the question.

- Truthfulness: The witness is being truthful in his current turn, as he is stating that he doesn't know if he told Mr. Duncan about the Photofete situation.

- Consistency: The witness's current response is inconsistent with his previous testimony, as he was asked about getting his story straight and now he's changing the subject to a specific conversation.

- Relevance: The witness's response is slightly relevant to the question, as it's related to the topic of getting his story straight, but it's not directly answering the question.

- Clarity: The witness's response is slightly unclear, as he's asking a question instead of directly answering the one posed to him.

- Outcome: The current turn outcome is in favor of the questioner, as the witness is not directly answering the question and is trying to deflect it.

- Reason for outcome: The reason for the outcome is that the logical arguments presented by the prosecution are convincing, as they are pointing out inconsistencies in the witness's testimony.","The prosecution is gaining ground in this cross-examination, but the witness is still trying to deflect the questions.",3,1,0,2,3,Questioner,1,0,1,0,-0.5,0.5,0.2,0.5,1.7,-1.4355566509309898,-1.059194903495181,0.15086141414285137,-0.37636174743580875

Explanation:

- Commitment level: The witness's response is beneficial to themselves, as they are trying to downplay the significance of the information. However, it's not entirely neutral, as they are still trying to avoid taking responsibility. I would rate it as a 2, beneficial commitment.

- Truthfulness: The witness's response seems evasive and unclear. They are not directly answering the question, which makes me question their truthfulness. I would rate it as 0, not truthful.

- Consistency: The witness's response is consistent with their previous testimony, as they have been trying to avoid taking responsibility and downplaying the significance of the information. I would rate it as 0, consistent.

- Relevance: The witness's response is slightly irrelevant to the question, as they are talking about the chairman's decision-making process instead of directly answering whether they contacted the chairman about the Photofete situation. I would rate it as 3, slightly irrelevant.

- Clarity: The witness's response is unclear, as they are using a vague phrase (""can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information"") to avoid taking responsibility. I would rate it as 4, unclear.

- Outcome: The current turn outcome is in favor of the questioner, as the witness's response seems evasive and unclear.

- Reason for the outcome: The reason for the outcome is the logical arguments presented by the questioner, which are convincing and highlight the witness's evasiveness.","The prosecution is more convincing in this turn, as the witness's response seems evasive and unclear.",2,0,1,3,4,Questioner,1,1,1,0,-0.6,1.0,1.1,1.5,2.8,-1.2561120695646162,-0.9821342417674405,0.12240736259009946,-0.2739778277971757

Explanation:

1. Commitment level: The witness is trying to deflect the question by saying ""I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston."" This response does not directly answer the question, so it's a neutral commitment (3).

2. Truthfulness in current turn: The witness is not being truthful in their current turn. They are trying to change the subject and avoid answering the question.

3. Consistency with previous testimony: The witness's current response is consistent with their previous testimony, as they have been trying to avoid direct answers throughout the cross-examination.

4. Response relevance: The witness's response is slightly irrelevant (3) to the question being asked.

5. Response clarity: The witness's response is slightly clear with hedging (2), as they are trying to deflect the question and avoid a direct answer.

6. Current turn outcome: The current turn outcome is in favor of the questioner (prosecution).

7. Reasons for current outcome: The prosecution's logical arguments are convincing (1), as they are pointing out the inconsistencies in the witness's previous testimony and trying to get a direct answer to the question.","The prosecution is gaining ground in this cross-examination, but the witness is still trying to deflect the questions.",3,0,1,3,2,Questioner,1,1,0,0,-0.6666666666666666,0.5,0.6000000000000001,2.0,3.4,-1.1663897788814293,-0.9401011535523093,0.10742444785540897,-0.22628862532911997

}

Explanation:

1. Commitment level: The witness is trying to maintain a neutral stance, but their responses are still somewhat evasive. They are not directly answering the question, but rather providing a justification for their actions. I would rate their commitment level as neutral (3).

2. Truthfulness: The witness is being truthful in their current turn, as they are stating their intentions and justifications. However, their truthfulness is somewhat limited by their evasive responses. I would rate their truthfulness as truthful (1).

3. Consistency: The witness's current response is inconsistent with their previous testimony. They initially stated that they didn't contact witnesses to get their story straight, but now they are justifying their actions by saying that they would have notified the chairman of the committee. I would rate their consistency as inconsistent (1).

4. Relevance: The witness's response is slightly relevant to the question, as they are providing a justification for their actions. However, their response is not directly answering the question, and is somewhat tangential. I would rate their relevance as slightly relevant (2).

5. Clarity: The witness's response is slightly clear, but they are using hedging language to justify their actions. They are not directly answering the question, and are providing a somewhat convoluted explanation. I would rate their clarity as slightly clear with hedging (2).

6. Current turn outcome: The prosecution is winning this turn, as they are successfully challenging the witness's testimony and forcing them to justify their actions.

7. Reasons for current outcome: The prosecution's logical arguments are convincing, as they are pointing out the inconsistencies in the witness's testimony and forcing them to justify their actions.","The prosecution is gaining ground in this cross-examination, but the witness is still trying to maintain a neutral stance.",3,1,0,2,2,Questioner,1.

Explanation:

1. Commitment level: The witness is making a beneficial commitment by stating that rules are important, but this is a vague statement that doesn't directly address the question. However, it's not detrimental to the prosecution, so I rate it as 2.

2. Truthfulness: The witness's statement that ""rules are important, but you should not be a slave to rules, either"" seems like a vague attempt to justify not following the rules. This response doesn't seem truthful, as it's a common tactic to downplay the importance of rules when accused of not following them. I rate it as 0.

3. Consistency: The witness's previous testimony was that the rules were very important, but now they're saying that one shouldn't be a slave to rules. This is inconsistent, so I rate it as 1.

4. Relevance: The witness's response is slightly relevant to the question, as it's trying to justify not following the rules. However, it's not directly addressing the question, so I rate it as 3.

5. Clarity: The witness's response is unclear, as it's a vague statement that doesn't directly address the question. I rate it as 4.

6. Outcome: The prosecution is winning this turn, as the witness's responses are becoming increasingly evasive and inconsistent.

Explanation:

1. Commitment level: The witness is trying to maintain a neutral stance by saying ""I don't"" and then hedging with ""I mean, he well may have said it."" This shows a lack of commitment to the question, which is beneficial to the witness but not entirely neutral. I would rate this as a 3.

2. Truthfulness in current turn: The witness is being truthful when they say they don't remember the statement. However, they are also being slightly evasive by hedging with ""he well may have said it."" I would rate this as 1.

3. Consistency with previous testimony: The witness is being inconsistent with their previous testimony, as they are now saying they don't remember the statement. In the previous testimony, they were being evasive and trying to downplay the importance of the statement. I would rate this as 1.

4. Response relevance: The witness's response is slightly relevant to the question, as it is related to the statement made by their attorney. However, it is not directly answering the question and is more of a deflection. I would rate this as 2.

5. Response clarity: The witness's response is slightly clear with hedging, as they are being evasive and trying to maintain a neutral stance. I would rate this as 2.

6. Current turn outcome: The current turn outcome is in favor of the questioner, as the witness is being evasive and inconsistent with their previous testimony. I would rate this as Questioner.

Explanation:

- Commitment level: The witness's response (""Yes, it was..."") is neutral, as it doesn't directly benefit or harm the witness, but it does provide an answer to the question. I rate it as 3.

- Truthfulness: The witness's response seems truthful, as it directly answers the question. However, considering the context of the conversation, it might be an attempt to deflect the prosecution's argument. I rate it as 1.

- Consistency: The witness's response is inconsistent with the prosecution's previous statement that selling property in Aspen was not a long, tedious process for the witness. I rate it as 1.

- Relevance: The witness's response is very relevant to the current topic of discussion, which is the witness's ability to sell their property in Aspen. I rate it as 1.

- Clarity: The witness's response is slightly unclear, as it doesn't directly address the prosecution's previous statement. The witness seems to be hedging their answer. I rate it as 2.

- Outcome: The current turn outcome is in favor of the questioner (prosecution), as they have successfully challenged the witness's previous statement.

- Reason for outcome: The prosecution's logical arguments are convincing, as they have pointed out the inconsistency in the witness's previous statement and the witness's response to the current question.

Explanation:

1. Commitment level: The witness is not committing to any specific answer, instead, they are hedging their response (""I'm not sure exactly when it was listed""). This indicates a lack of commitment to the truth, which benefits the questioner.

2. Truthfulness: The witness's response is not truthful, as they are not providing a clear answer to the question.

3. Consistency: The witness's response is consistent with their previous testimony, as they have been evasive and unclear throughout the cross-examination.

4. Response relevance: The witness's response is slightly relevant, as it is related to the question about the listing of the Aspen property.

5. Response clarity: The witness's response is unclear, as they are not providing a clear answer to the question.

2. Truthfulness: The witness's response seems truthful, as they are providing a plausible explanation for the quick sale of their property.

3. Consistency: The witness's response is inconsistent with their previous testimony, as they initially stated that selling property in Aspen was a long and tedious process, but now claim that it was sold quickly.

4. Response relevance: The witness's response is very relevant to the current question, as it directly addresses the prosecution's claim that the witness had a potential buyer lined up for their property.

5. Response clarity: The witness's response is slightly clear with hedging, as they provide a plausible explanation but also seem to be downplaying the significance of the quick sale.

Explanation:

1. Commitment level: The witness's response (""Yes"") is a direct answer to the question, but it seems to be a simple affirmation without much elaboration. I would rate it as a neutral commitment (3).

2. Truthfulness: The witness's response seems to be truthful, as it directly answers the question. However, considering the context of the previous testimony, it might be a convenient answer to avoid further questioning. I would rate it as truthful (1).

3. Consistency: The witness's response is inconsistent with their previous testimony. They initially stated that selling property in Aspen was a long and tedious process, but now they are saying it was sold quickly. I would rate it as inconsistent (1).

4. Response relevance: The witness's response is very relevant to the current line of questioning, as it directly addresses the prosecution's claim that the witness sold their property quickly. I would rate it as very relevant (1).

5. Response clarity: The witness's response is very clear, as it directly answers the question. I would rate it as very clear (1).

And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?

D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

PROSECUTION: Remember the May, 2001, e-mail from Mr. Herrold advising you of a choice between accessing money from other lines of credit or selling back

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

PROSECUTION: Remember the May, 2001, e-mail from Mr. Herrold advising you of a choice between accessing money from other lines of credit or selling back
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: – Enron stock?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So, that's choice number one, $11 million available?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And choice number two, selling assets that were summing in excess of $13 million of non-Enron stock. That was also available as an option as well, correct?

Explanation:

- Commitment level: The witness's response, ""That appears to be so,"" is a neutral commitment, as it doesn't provide any additional information or clarification. It's a simple affirmation of the prosecution's statement, which doesn't benefit or harm the witness's case.

- Truthfulness: The witness's response seems truthful, as it's a direct affirmation of the prosecution's statement. However, the witness's previous testimony has shown inconsistencies, which raises concerns about his overall truthfulness.

- Consistency: The witness's response is consistent with his previous testimony, as he has acknowledged the availability of other lines of credit and assets that could have been used to meet the margin call.

- Relevance: The witness's response is very relevant to the current discussion, as it directly addresses the prosecution's question about the availability of other lines of credit and assets.

- Clarity: The witness's response is slightly clear with hedging, as it's a simple affirmation of the prosecution's statement without providing any additional context or clarification.

- Outcome: The current turn outcome favors the prosecution, as they have effectively challenged the witness's credibility and consistency.

- Reason for outcome: The logical arguments presented by the prosecution are convincing, making a strong case against the witness.","The prosecution has effectively challenged the witness's credibility and consistency, making a strong case against him.",3,0,1,1,2,Questioner,1.

70,70,Q/A,"All right. So, sir, in sum, then, from July 26th through September 4th, when you sold $24 million of stock, you, in fact, had choices other than selling Enron stock during this period of time leading up to the online forum; isn't that right, sir?","There were other options, Mr. Hueston.",enron_defense_2,"PROSECUTION: Mr. Petrocelli asked Mr. Skilling, ""Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight? His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: – Enron stock?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So, that's choice number one, $11 million available?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And choice number two, selling assets that were summing in excess of $13 million of non-Enron stock. That was also available as an option as well, correct?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be so.

PROSECUTION: All right. So, sir, in sum, then, from July 26th through September 4th, when you sold $24 million of stock, you, in fact, had choices other than selling Enron stock during this period of time leading up to the online forum; isn't that right, sir?
D_WITNESS: There were other options, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, Mr. Beau Herrold assisted you in managing your finances?
D_WITNESS: He did.

PROSECUTION: But you ultimately were in charge, correct? He took direction from you?

Explanation:

1. Commitment level: The witness's response is neutral, as they are not directly committing to any specific action or decision. They are providing a general explanation of their relationship with Mr. Herrold, but not taking a clear stance.

2. Truthfulness: The witness's response seems evasive and potentially misleading. They are downplaying their role in managing their finances and the decisions made by Mr. Herrold. This suggests that the witness may not be telling the whole truth.

3. Consistency: The witness's response is consistent with their previous testimony, as they have consistently downplayed their involvement in managing their finances.

4. Relevance: The witness's response is slightly relevant to the question, as it provides some insight into their relationship with Mr. Herrold and their decision-making process.

5. Clarity: The witness's response is slightly unclear, as they are using hedging language and providing a general explanation rather than a clear answer.

6. Current turn outcome: The questioner (prosecution) is winning this turn, as they are successfully challenging the witness's credibility and highlighting inconsistencies in their testimony.

7. Reasons for current outcome: The prosecution's logical arguments are convincing, as they are using specific examples and evidence to challenge the witness's claims. This is making it difficult for the witness to provide clear and consistent answers.","The prosecution is gaining ground in this cross-examination, and the witness's responses are becoming increasingly evasive and inconsistent.",3,0,1,2,3,Questioner,1.

73,73,Q/A,"Right. Well, one of the more important things would be to work with you to avoid selling any more shares than you had to during this time period. That would be important to you, correct?","Yes, it would . . .",enron_defense_2,"PROSECUTION: Mr. Petrocelli asked Mr. Skilling, ""Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight? His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

D_WITNESS: He did.

PROSECUTION: But you ultimately were in charge, correct? He took direction from you?
D_WITNESS: Well, certainly, I was-I could overturn any recommendation or decision that they were making. And-but they would try to run, certainly, the more important decisions by me if they could, I mean, if I was reachable. Quite often, if I was traveling, they had to go ahead and kind of do whatever they could do.

PROSECUTION: Right. Well, one of the more important things would be to work with you to avoid selling any more shares than you had to during this time period. That would be important to you, correct?

Quite often, if I was traveling, they had to go ahead and kind of do whatever they could do.

PROSECUTION: Right. Well, one of the more important things would be to work with you to avoid selling any more shares than you had to during this time period. That would be important to you, correct?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it would . . .

PROSECUTION: It’s an e-mail from Mr. Herrold to you, dated May 21st, 2001.

COURT: All right. It's admitted.

PROSECUTION: I'll read it aloud. It's from Mr. Herrold to you, Mr. Lay, on May 21, 2001?
D_WITNESS: Yes. Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: Okay. One choice was to use $5.9 million of available monies on your Bank of America line of credit, correct?

78,78,Q/A,"And the other was to use money from your Enron line of credit, right?",Yes.,enron_defense_2,"PROSECUTION: Mr. Petrocelli asked Mr. Skilling, ""Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight? His answer was: ""No.” I’ll pose that question to you, Mr. Lay: Did you have one conversation with one person about getting your story straight for trial?
D_WITNESS: And again, could you elaborate on that, Mr. Hueston? I mean, what story are you talking about?

PROSECUTION: Are you having trouble with that question? I’m just posing the same question?
D_WITNESS: Well, I'm not sure I – I’m telling stories up here. I'm up here to answer your questions.

PROSECUTION: Have you contacted witnesses to get your story straight?
D_WITNESS: I – I – I don’t know that I contacted witnesses.

PROSECUTION: [Hueston asked Lay about his $120,000 investment in Photophete, a company doing business with Enron.]
D_WITNESS: Do you know if I told Mr. Duncan, the chairman of that committee, about the Photofete situation?

PROSECUTION: What we know and what you know, as the writer of those rules, is that telling one person-if it ever happened-does not satisfy your own rules . . .
D_WITNESS: I would think that the chairman of that committee, just like the chairman of any committee at Enron, can make a decision as to what he or she would like to do with that information or needs to do with that information.

PROSECUTION: Even though that's not what's called for by the code of conduct that you wrote, right?
D_WITNESS: I think we're now getting into form over substance, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: Well, that's what you would call your rules, then, form over substance, right?
D_WITNESS: No. The rules were very-very important. But, again, if I did notify Mr. Duncan, which I normally would have, then I would Jet him decide whether to take it up with the full committee or whether, in fact, it was even a large enough investment that he should take the time of the full committee.

PROSECUTION: Right. The rules were important, but you didn't follow them?
D_WITNESS: Rules are important, but they should not-you should not be a slave to rules, either....

PROSECUTION: One of the things your attorney said in opening was, quote, “He had real estate in Aspen. He could have sold his home up there. But that’s a long, tedious process; and he's got a wife and children to put up with."" Do you remember that statement?
D_WITNESS: I don't. I find the phrasing kind of interesting; but, no, I do not. I mean, he well may have said it.

PROSECUTION: Selling property in Aspen, in fact, was not a long, tedious process for you, was it?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it was....

PROSECUTION: Let’s focus on this [Aspen property] for a moment. That lot was listed for $10 million, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And you didn’t list it until January 21st, 2002, after you sold all your Enron stock, right?
D_WITNESS: I’m not sure exactly when it was listed; but it was certainly after the bankruptcy....

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, listing date was January 21st, right, sir?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: The contract date was just two days later. You had a sales contract in hand just two days later, didn't you?
D_WITNESS: Yes, we did. Apparently there was a potential buyer known to our real estate agent up there, that wanted the property; and-and that transaction was-was negotiated and sold very quickly.

PROSECUTION: You got $10 million, the full asking price, within two days, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And, in fact, it was an all-cash offer, as well, wasn’t it?
D_WITNESS: It was.

PROSECUTION: Stock first, sales of real estate later?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: . . . [L]et's remind the jury of what you said when you were describing why it is that you felt you didn't have to tell the employees about these sales during this period of time ... And let's read this. ""My personal belief is that Enron stock is an incredible bargain at current prices, and we will look back a couple of years from now and see the great opportunity that we currently have."" And that’s the latter part of the quote where it mentions that you had been buying stock in the last couple of months. And then you answer: ""Yes. And in fact, I had purchased the 4 million of shares, and I always separated the optional, discretionary decisions I was making with my money versus those ... that, in fact, were forced, as the margin calls were forcing the sale of some of the other shares."" That's what you said, right?
D_WITNESS: Yes, it is.

PROSECUTION: All right. Well, let's look at the choices that you had on July 26th.... [O]n July 25th your line of credit was getting a margin call for $483,000, correct, sir?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be, yes.

PROSECUTION: And in response to that $483,426 margin call, you sold $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, correct?
D_WITNESS: If I did go back to Enron on the line of credit, I usually would go for the full amount.

PROSECUTION: [S]o what you're saying is, even though you had a margin call of just $483,000, you went ahead and used that margin call as a reason to draw a full $4 million down or to sell $4 million of Enron stock back to Enron, right?
D_WITNESS: I most usually would do that in order to have some additional liquidity versus whatever the margin call was.

PROSECUTION: All right. So a good $3.5 million was not required by the margin call that day, correct?
D_WITNESS: Apparently not....

PROSECUTION: So on July 26, sir, on this now familiar document, it indicates your total borrowing power on the secured lines was $9.5 million and in your unsecured lines below an additional $2.25 million. And so, in fact, you had over $11 million worth of borrowing options off your other lines of credit on that day available to you to satisfy that half-a-million-dollar or so margin call, correct?
D_WITNESS: Well, apparently.

PROSECUTION: So, your choices on July 26th, sir, to meet the margin call of $483,426 was $11 million worth of balance availability and other lines of credit, right? That's in category choice number one and the very sort of choice that Mr. Herrold provided you that we saw by e-mail in May of 2001. Do you remember that?
D_WITNESS: I'm sorry. An e-mail by Mr. Herrold when?

PROSECUTION: Remember the May, 2001, e-mail from Mr. Herrold advising you of a choice between accessing money from other lines of credit or selling back
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: – Enron stock?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: So, that's choice number one, $11 million available?
D_WITNESS: Yes.

PROSECUTION: And choice number two, selling assets that were summing in excess of $13 million of non-Enron stock. That was also available as an option as well, correct?
D_WITNESS: That appears to be so.

PROSECUTION: All right. So, sir, in sum, then, from July 26th through September 4th, when you sold $24 million of stock, you, in fact, had choices other than selling Enron stock during this period of time leading up to the online forum; isn't that right, sir?
D_WITNESS: There were other options, Mr. Hueston.

PROSECUTION: All right. Now, Mr. Beau Herrold assisted you in managing your finances?
D_WITNESS: He did.

PROSECUTION: But you ultimately were in charge, correct? He took direction from you?
D_WITNESS: Well, certainly, I was-I could overturn any recommendation or decision that they were making. And-but they would try to run, certainly, the more important decisions by me if they could, I mean, if I was reachable. Quite often, if I was traveling, they had to go ahead and kind of do whatever they could do.
