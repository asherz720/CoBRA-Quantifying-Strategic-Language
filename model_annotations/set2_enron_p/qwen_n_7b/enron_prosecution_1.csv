DEFENSE: Would you like to take a break, sir?
nan: nan

COURT: Why don't we take about a ten-minute break?
nan: nan

OTHERS: I'm fine. I'm fine…
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Are you afraid, sir, as you sit here now? Do you have a fear of giving an answer that might alienate the Government because of the control they have over the rest of your life?
P_WITNESS: No.

DEFENSE: You have no fear at all?
P_WITNESS: I'm past that....If I can answer your earlier question, my children, two are in college and one in high school.

DEFENSE: I appreciate that.
