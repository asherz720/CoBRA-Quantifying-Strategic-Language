30,30,Q/A,I appreciate that.,"And entering into this guilty plea, it's not hard to tell them that. And I'm over the big fear.",enron_prosecution_1,"DEFENSE: Now, when you entered into this plea of guilty, had you been informed that there was a substantial amount of incriminating evidence against you?
P_WITNESS: I knew there - nobody had to have the other evidence. I knew it myself.

DEFENSE: Other than what you personally thought in your own mind, did someone show you any incriminating e-mails that showed that you were guilty?
P_WITNESS: I reviewed my conduct for many years after I left Enron as I was defending myself in the civil cases. Yes, I was guilty of aiding and abetting securities fraud....I didn't plead guilty to one statement on this conference call. That's not petty or whatever you called it – thin? I don't think it's thin or I wouldn't have pled guilty to it. You have three Q and A items there- No. That's not-

DEFENSE: -cited there.
P_WITNESS: They're cited here, yes. I wished that was all I did.

DEFENSE: So, back to my question, then. You're still in the mode of protecting yourself, aren't you?
P_WITNESS: I don't know what you mean by ""protecting"" myself, but I don't feel that in the last three days I've protected myself in any way.

DEFENSE: What does it mean to say ""the Department's assessment of the value of your assistance and your cooperation""?
P_WITNESS: The fullness. The – staying on the right track, not-not concentrating on little issues or avoiding the questions. I would put that in the value category.

DEFENSE: Might it also include how helpful you were to the cause of the Government?
P_WITNESS: No.

DEFENSE: Are you sure of that?
P_WITNESS: I'm sure of that, because I don't know that I will, by all means and everything I say, help the Government....

DEFENSE: And at the time you pled guilty, how old were your three children?
P_WITNESS: Two of them. . .

DEFENSE: Would you like to take a break, sir?
nan: nan

COURT: Why don't we take about a ten-minute break?
nan: nan

OTHERS: I'm fine. I'm fine…
nan: nan

DEFENSE: Are you afraid, sir, as you sit here now? Do you have a fear of giving an answer that might alienate the Government because of the control they have over the rest of your life?
P_WITNESS: No.

DEFENSE: You have no fear at all?
P_WITNESS: I'm past that....If I can answer your earlier question, my children, two are in college and one in high school.

DEFENSE: I appreciate that.
